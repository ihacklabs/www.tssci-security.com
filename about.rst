tssci security is part of the `Security Bloggers
Network <http://networks.feedburner.com/Security-Bloggers-Network>`_,
and our team consists of Marcin Wielgoszewski and Andre Gironda. Team
TSSCI has a diverse background in computer security and security related
topics that span several years working in many different environments of
varying criticality. Our research delves into web application security,
server and infrastructure virtualization, cloud computing, trusted
systems, and software security and assurance.

TSSCI stands for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information, a
security clearance used in the defense and intelligence fields. An SCI
clearance differs from a regular "top secret" or "secret" clearance in
that SCI requires an explicit need-to-know to classified intelligence
information concerning or derived from sensitive sources, methods, or
analytical processes.
