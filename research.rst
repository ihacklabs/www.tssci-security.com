A Breath of Fresh Burp: Extending Burp the Python Way
=====================================================
`PDF <https://speakerdeck.com/marcinw/a-breath-of-fresh-burp>`__
\| ODP \| PPT \| Video \| Paper

**Abstract**: Many of us rely on Burp Suite as our go-to tool for web
application security testing. Burp has made the lives of many pentesters
easier as it was developed with web app security testing in mind. However,
Burp doesn’t always do what you want out of the box, and so it exposes an
Extender API for anyone to willing enough to write plugins in Java.
 
Having to write Java code aside, developing plugins can be a painstaking
process due to having to restart the Java Virtual Machine every time the
plugin code is modified.
 
In this talk we’ll review the various framework APIs available to pentesters
looking to get the most out of Burp using Jython. We’ll also discuss a new
way of writing plugins for Burp, without having to write a single line of
Java and without having to restart Burp every time a plugin is modified.
 
Code and example use cases will be presented that’ll show how using Jython
and Burp can make you a more effective web application pentester.

Constricting the Web: Offensive Python for Web Hackers
======================================================

**Abstract**: It seems that everything is a web application nowadays.
Whether the application is cloud-based, mobile, or even fat client they
all seem to be using web protocols to communicate. Adding to the
traditional landscape there is rise in the use of application programming
interfaces, integration hooks, and next generation web technologies. What
this means for someone testing web applications is that flexibility is the
key to success. The Python programming language is just as flexible as
today’s web application platforms. The language is appealing to security
professionals because it is easy to read and write, has a wide variety of
modules, and has plenty of resources for help. This additional flexibility
affords the tester greater depth than many of the canned tests that come
with common tools they use on a daily basis. Greater familiarity plus
flexible language equals tester win!

In this presentation we introduce methods with which to create your own
clients, tools, and test cases using the Python programming language. We
want to put testers closer to the conditions in which they are testing for
and arm them with the necessary resources to be successful. We also
discuss interfacing with current tools that people commonly use for web
application testing. This allows for pinpoint identification of specific
vulnerabilities and conditions that are difficult for other tools to
identify.

Fracking Flex / Pentesting Adobe Flex Applications
==================================================

`PDF </pub/2010_SummerC0n_NY-Wielgoszewski-Pentesting_Flex.pdf>`__
\| ODP \| PPT \| Video \| Paper

**Abstract:** Web applications have become increasingly more complex
over the years. Users are demanding a rich content experience that is
both simple and pleasant to use. In addition to the increased
complexity, applications are utilizing a mix of technologies to support
this drive. One such technology is Flex, which utilizes the Adobe Flash
Platform to deliver Rich Internet Applications to users.

With increased complexity comes a downside. Application security testers
often hit roadblocks when assessing Flex applications due to the use of
binary protocols and custom objects going across the wire. This talk
will provide testers an understanding of the architecture components
that make up Flex applications and an assessment methodology for
security testing. In addition, several tools will be discussed that will
help the tester perform a thorough security review of a Flex
application.

Securosis: Building a Web Application Security Program
======================================================

PDF \| ODP \| PPT \| Video \|
`Paper <http://securosis.com/research/publication/web-application-security-program/>`__

**Abstract:** Web Applications not only have many of the same threats
and issues as traditional applications, but by their nature, have a
whole additional set of issues to worry about as well. They require a
different approach and analysis, and we hope that you will follow the
use cases and adapt the technologies and process improvements suggested
to meet your organizational needs.

AntiSamy.NET: Fighting XSS the .NET Way
=======================================

`PDF </pub/2008_OWASP_EU_Summit-Wielgoszewski-AntiSamydotNET.pdf>`__
\| ODP \| PPT \| Video \| Paper

**Abstract:** AntiSamy.NET is the direct .NET port of AntiSamy for
Java. Originally developed by Arshan Dabirsiaghi and Jason Li of Aspect
Security, Jerry Hoff has been porting AntiSamy to .NET in this OWASP
Summer of Code 2008 project. This talk presents the community with a
project overview and status update on the work completed to date. For
more information please visit the `OWASP AntiSamy.NET project
homepage <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project_.NET>`_.

\| Paper

**Abstract:** This talk will cover what XPath is, how it is used to
parse XML in web applications in order to aid security testing tools,
and why XPath expressions are good locators in comparison to other
methods such as DOM or CSS selectors. The presenters will attempt to
demonstrate how XPath can be used for good instead of being targeted
with injection or blind XPath injection attacks.

**Abstract:** Continuous testing presents methodologies and tools that
developers, quality engineers, and security professionals can all share
and use effectively to their own unique approach. The tools presented
are cross-discipline, meaning they can be utilized by a developer as a
development tool, by a qa-tester as a quality assurance tool, and by a
vulnerability assessor as a security assurance tool. Whether you're
trying to build better code faster, demonstrate the power of automated
testing using a data-driven test framework, or find security-related
defects – Continuous testing has something for you.
