title: Looking forward to OWASP EU Summit Portugal

Looking forward to OWASP EU Summit Portugal
###########################################

In only a couple weeks, many of the greatest minds in web application
security will come together again for `OWASP EU
Summit <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008>`_ in
Algarve, Portugal. The Summit is a gathering whose main goal is, besides
promoting the exchange of ideas on web application security, defining
the future of OWASP itself. In other words: Do you want to help define
the future of web application security? If so, the OWASP Summit is the
place to be.

This year, the Summit will happen in November, from the 3rd to the 7th,
in Portugal. It will offer a great selection of training and technical
sessions, regarding the most important OWASP projects and themes. It
will also host a business track dealing with the usage of OWASP
generated documents and tools by companies worldwide and with the
opportunities for these companies to help OWASP's development. It will
be a great opportunity to meet the people that make a difference in the
web security arena.

I will be attending, as a reviewer for
`AntiSamy.NET <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project_.NET>`_
and also to join in the discussion on
`browser <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_Browser_Security>`_
and
`framework <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_Web_Application_Framework_Security>`_
security, a workshop hosted by the `Intrinsic Security Working
Group <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Intrinsic_Security_Working_Group>`_.
I'll be flying out several days earlier to do a little tourism -- gotta
make the most of "training" days ;) -- so if anyone has been to the area
before and has any recommendations, I'd love to hear them.

Don't forget to check out the
`training <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008#TRAINING_COURSES_-_November_3rd_.26_4th_.28Mon.2C_Tue.29>`_

sessions <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008#WORKING_SESSIONS_-_November_4th_.26_5th_.28Tue.2C_Wed.29>`_
