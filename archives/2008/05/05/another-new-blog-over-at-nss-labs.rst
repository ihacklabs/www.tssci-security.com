title: Another new blog over at NSS Labs

Another new blog over at NSS Labs
#################################

Not to be outdone by `Neohapsis
Labs <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2008/04/28/new-blog-over-at-neohapsis-labs/>`_,
NSS Labs also enters the fray with their blog, `Security Product
Testing <http://nsslabs.blogspot.com>`_. Again, I think that NSS Labs
(like Neohapsis Labs) has been blogging for awhile, but it has picked up
more pace lately.

In the past, the `TS/SCI Security blog staff were invited as
guests <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2008/01/30/guests-on-network-security-podcast/>`_
by Martin McKeay for the `Network Security
Podcast <http://netsecpodcast.com>`_. `Rick Moy of NSS
Labs <http://www.mckeay.net/2008/04/09/rsa-2008-rick-moy-nss-labs/>`_
got the opportunity to speak his mind with Martin while at the RSA
Conference. Rick was additionally interviewed by the `Bank Information
Security Podcasts <http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/podcasts.php>`_ on
`Product
Testing <http://nsslabs.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-interview-with-tom-field-of.html>`_.
Both of these might be worth a listen for the discerning security
professional.

Last week, NSS Labs `approved the Radware DefensePro
1020 <http://www.nsslabs.com/attack-mitigator/Radware-DP-1020>`_ for
attack mitigation purposes. They claim that, "The DefensePro 1020
blocked 100 percent of attacks while passing 100 percent of legitimate
traffic without need for user intervention". I really like what NSS Labs
wrote on `Security Products & PCI
Compliance <http://nsslabs.blogspot.com/2007/10/pci-compliance-is-good-thing.html>`_,
where they state that:

    Fact: No product will make you compliant. But having an inadequate
    or misconfigured product can prevent you from achieving compliance.

We're hoping to see/hear more from NSS Labs in the future!
