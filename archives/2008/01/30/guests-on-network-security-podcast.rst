Guests on Network Security Podcast
##################################

The other night, we had the special privilege of being guests on `Martin
McKeay's <http://www.mckeay.net/>`_ `Network Security
Podcast <http://netsecpodcast.com/>`_ with co-host `Rich
Mogull <http://securosis.com/>`_. While having a great time several
weeks ago at SunSec, and several beers into the night, we tricked Mogull
into letting us crash the podcast... j/k :D

We started off with `Mystery Malware affecting Linux/Apache
websites <http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/24/1930207>`_,
which lead to a discussion on web application security and how we can go
about solving the problems. From there, we introduced our talk at
ShmooCon and gave some more details as to what we've been doing.

You can download this `episode 92 of the Network Security
Podcast <http://netsecpodcast.com/?p=15>`_. Martin usually has a...
let's say, "different" taste in music than us, but the song he played
last night was pretty funny \`-\`- If this Geek Ruled the World.
