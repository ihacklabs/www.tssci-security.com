I have one ShmooCon ticket available for $300. Contact me if you are
interested.

Why do I have one ShmooCon ticket for sale? I bought it in case we
didn't get accepted to ShmooCon, but we did! Dre, Tom Stracener of
Cenzic (and formerly nCircle), and I will be giving a talk on:

**Path X: Explosive Security Testing Tools Using XPath** We will cover
what XPath is, how it is used to parse XML in web applications in order
to aid security testing tools, and why XPath expressions are good
locators in comparison to other methods such as DOM or CSS selectors. We
will attempt to demonstrate how XPath can be used for good instead of
being targeted with injection or blind XPath injection attacks.

Check the `ShmooCon Speakers list <http://shmoocon.org/speakers.html>`_
for all the talks. If you're going to ShmooCon as well and want to hang
out, post a comment. We can't wait for this years `Podcasters
Meetup <http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/414823/>`_ -- last years totally
rocked. There is going to be a lot happening and it's all going to be a
lot of fun.

**New Look**

We have changed our look slightly and have a new theme. You might not
notice much of a difference if all you read is our RSS. We hope that the
new theme makes it easier for those who come to our site be able to read
longer posts more easily. Not to mention, it's faster, simpler, and
cleaner... and I had it validating XHTML 1.0 Strict on my staging
server, but not anymore. If anyone can help me out that'd be great,
getting 100% Strict validation was pretty cool for those 15 minutes. :/

**Research**

Dre and I have been pouring a ton of research into web testing tools and
using those tools to find vulnerabilities in web applications. Some
coincides with the information we have put into our talk, which we will
be publishing soon.
