SunSec Trip Report
##################

Last night `Rich Mogull of Securosis <http://securosis.com/>`_, and
`co-host of Network Security Podcast <http://netsecpodcast.com/>`_,
hosted SunSec (which was on hiatus for far too long) at the Furio in
Scottsdale. It was a great turnout last night -- about twenty people had
shown up and talked up all kinds of storms for several hours.

Dre and I talked with Dennis Groves, one of the founding members of
OWASP and contributor to the OWASP Guide. Dennis had mentioned the
`DARPA Browser Project <http://www.combex.com/tech/darpaBrowser.html>`_
and we then talked about trusted systems and how software assurance
through formal methods will fix all the security problems.

Obviously with Mogull we had to talk about data security -- his
specialty, and what's also obvious he is a rockstar at it. Where are all
the other security researchers that are into data security like he is??
All I can count and know of is `Dan
Geer <http://www.verdasys.com/mt_geer.php>`_, `Rob
Newby <http://robnewby.blogspot.com/>`_ and `Gunnar
Peterson <http://1raindrop.typepad.com/>`_ (oh, and `Christofer
Hoff <http://rationalsecurity.typepad.com/blog/>`_ too!). We also had
brought up the little SCADA hack/hoax that Hoff and him had tried to
pull a couple weeks ago. Trailing off, we then got into a discussion
about hacking train controllers, and what do I notice in my feed reader
this morning? Courtesy of `Domber's
Basecamp <http://code-foundation.de/>`_: `Schoolboy hacks into city's
tram
system <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/11/wschool111.xml>`_.

All in all, SunSec rocked. If you live in the Phoenix area, you
definitely have to make it to the next one.
