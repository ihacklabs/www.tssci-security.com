title: CERT on Securing your web browser

CERT on Securing your web browser
#################################

'Lo and behold, CERT has an excellent document on `Securing your web
browser <http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/>`_! They cover
IE, Firefox, and Safari -- three secure references for the three most
popular browsers.

The documentation and links provided are great. I was actually surprised
that they covered quite a bit of important topics and that the
recommendations they gave are rather solid. To be honest, at first sight
I was expecting a lot less.

However -- as good CERT's guide is, you won't want to miss our past blog
posts on safe/secure browsing, which are stacking up like hot-cakes:

   browsing <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/08/15/8-firefox-extensions-towards-safer-browsing/>`_
