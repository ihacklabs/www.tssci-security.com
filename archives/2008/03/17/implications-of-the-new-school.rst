Implications of The New School
##############################

Recently, I finished reading "The New School of Information Security" by
Adam Shostack and Andrew Stewart. It's only about 200 pages, so it's
certainly worth your time to pick up and read. Some people will compare
it to "Security Metrics" by Andrew Jaquith (or many others), but I think
this book is very unique.

Into the first chapter, I was dismayed and rather disappointed. At first
it appeared as if the book would largely be a repeat of some Shostack
and Geer presentations I've already seen in the past. The introduction
looked like a sample of `Dan Geer's testimony to
Congress <http://homeland.house.gov/hearings/index.asp?ID=41>`_,
*Addressing the Nation's Cybersecurity Challenges: Reducing
Vulnerabilities Requires Strategic Investment and Immediate Action*.
This set me off to the whole book since I've already read that paper.

Additionally, the authors immediately begin the book with how they are
going to write it -- how they don't reference anything in great detail,
but that the endnotes should suffice. This also put me off a bit... that
is -- until I got to the endnotes! Certainly from the beginning to the
end of the book I was also kept in a state of constant interest thanks
to the excellent writing. Even if you have read all of their past work,
this book is certainly worth a read or two or three, maybe even
quarterly.

**Searching for answers**

Since the authors seemed to dump on all security technology products and
solutions, I began to get defensive in my mind about how to address my
own technology suggestions around the information security space. While
I wasn't completely surprised that the authors did not hold the exact
same views that I do -- I was hoping that they would have spoke to
software assurance, security in the SDLC, and other practices that I
tout.

No such luck; the authors provided very few answers in general. This is
probably a preferred message because it makes the book timeless in a
way. "Security changes over time", right?

Some positive answers that were most clear to me from reading the text
came across as, "process over products", and "economics over
technology". For process, the authors seemed to suggest one reoccurring
theme about the three most important IT controls that can aid
decision-making:

-  Asset management / Inventory management
-  Change management / Change control
-  Configuration management

I'm obviously fine with the above in theory. However, in practice --
these are often required by the ITIL, COBIT, ISO27k, and NIST standards
that the book seems to want to throw out the door. Not only that, but
the focus seemed to me as completely attached to IT/Operations and
having nothing to do with development.

After further digging into the endnotes and references, it became more
apparent what the authors were suggesting. The authors were trying to
say that most of ITIL, COBIT, et al -- is completely worthless. Studies
such as `Visible Ops <http://www.itpi.org/home/visibleops.php>`_ (which
appears to be ready for a `second
title <http://www.itpi.org/cs/blogs/itpi/archive/2008/01/28/1532.aspx>`_
according to the `Visible Ops
blog <http://www.itpi.org/cs/blogs/itpi/>`_), have more clearly
demonstrated that a few choice controls are higher-performing and more
efficient than a large majority of the controls listed in those audit
frameworks. Now, this concept is very believable.

For statistics, popular cybercrime surveys such as the annual report
produced by the Computer Security Institute were thrown out the
proverbial window by the authors, but they were able to point to newer
data, such as the `IT Controls Performance
Study <http://www.itpi.org/home/performance_study.php>`_ as well as the
`DOJ/DHS National Computer Security Survey <http://ncss.rand.org>`_
(available sometime soon -- 2008 according to the website).

**Answers in the breach data**

One thing I learned from the book is the importance of breach data to
further our understanding of future answers. I tend to concentrate on
software development requirements, software engineering design, and raw
source code as metrics and patterns. However, the authors bring up some
excellent points about breach data.

Breach data is important to get out in the open, and I've mentioned a
few sources on our blog before. One project that I wasn't familiar with
was the `New York State freedom of information
laws <http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2007/01/a_request.html>`_
that Chris Walsh posted about last year. I've seen some of CWalsh's
other work and I've spoken with him, and I had no idea he worked on such
an interesting project. This is certainly a project you might not want
to miss out on.

**Answers in Economics models and Social Psychology theories**

This might seem too academic for most security professionals. However,
these same security professionals are usually armchair experts
themselves. I find these recommendations the most fascinating and
relevant. I hope the rest of the industry will give these ideas the
chance that they deserve.

Quoted several times throughout the book is a paper by Gordon and Loeb,
on `The Economics of Information Security
Investment <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=PbzP9tgeDcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&ots=8AHrACmbJ-&sig=teiN90sBAH5drq5PmuQzk7G2tbs#PPA105,M1>`_
(it's only 22 pages long). The authors consider this a must read, and
tend to summarize this paper as "only spend up to 37% of the value of an
asset in order to protect that asset". I enjoyed this recommendation, as
well as the authors disdain for ROI / ROSI and ALE. However, while I
think their strategy will work for the long-term (and once we have more
data), my short-term recommendation continues to be a bit contrary to
this.

In `Building a security
plan <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/12/10/building-a-security-plan/>`_,
I discussed (towards the end) how using the voice of the customer to
drive your spending decisions seemed about as appropriate as any other
strategy. I would have appreciated some discussion around customer
support, and maybe this is a topic that the authors will bring up in the
future.

The authors also discussed how Psychology (many of the topics appear to
be centered around Social Psychology at the root of the problems, IMO),
and the authors explored a few concepts. One of the more prominent
psychology topics was regarding Security & Usability, which I'm sure
there are varying levels of opinion about.

After speaking with Marcin -- I was pointed towards an excellent blog
post on `psychology needs for security
teams <http://www.packetknife.com/3x09_3x10/2007/01/staff_psycholog.html>`_.
Not only is the topic of Security & Usability discussed, but a very
interesting look into the future.

I see a bright future in the New School, and would put this book as a
"first-read" for anyone who needs to be initiated on the subject of
information security / assurance.
