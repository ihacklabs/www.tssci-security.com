Firefox 3 first impressions
###########################

I've downloaded and used the Firefox 3 beta browser software for the
past few months and wanted to give a report on the latest of what works
and what doesn't. Note that I had to install Nightly Tester Tools to get
many of these to work. I am also now using the Classic Compact theme,
which has some minor annoyances but better than most alternatives.

Working:

-  Add N Edit Cookies
-  asdf
-  Cert Viewer Plus
-  CookieCuller
-  CookieSafe
-  CookieSwap
-  Dust-Me Selectors
-  FireBug
-  FormFox
-  GreaseMonkey
-  InspectThis (however, it won't work unless you install DOM Inspector,
   which is now only available as part of the custom installation -- not
   as an add-on!)
-  JSView (although it doesn't work in Page Info, which limits its use
   in my opinion)
-  Live HTTP Headers
-  Modify Headers
-  NF-Tools
-  NoScript
-  Public Fox
-  RefControl
-  SafeCache
-  SafeHistory
-  Technika
-  Update Notifier
-  UrlParams
-  User Agent Switcher
-  View Dependencies (which, along with Page Info Button -- is now my
   favorite extension)
-  Web Developer
-  YSlow (this wasn't working until Firefox 3 beta 4)
-  XPath Checker
-  XPather

Not working:

-  ASnumber (it's not updating the statusbar)
-  Flash Switcher
-  Header Monitor (it's not updating the statusbar)
-  LocalRodeo
-  Named Anchors
-  Storage Inspector (installs but doesn't work correctly)
-  View Cookies (but it's no longer necessary)
-  View Source Chart (installs but doesn't work at all)

Required maxVersion modification (some have this updated to 3.0b3 but
not 3.0b4!):

-  Page Info Button
-  Tamper Data
-  ASCIItoUnicode
-  Flash Tracer
-  Cookie Watcher (however, it's not enumerating all the cookies for me
   anymore)

Overall, I think that Firefox 3 is much better on memory, faster, and
more useful. However, it may not be any more secure than Firefox 2. Stay
tuned for more information on creating a secure Firefox profile. I'll be
looking at the security of Firefox 3 beta 4 and compare it to earlier
Firefox 3 betas, as well as Firefox 2.
