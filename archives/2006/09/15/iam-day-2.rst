title: IAM Day 2

IAM Day 2
#########

It's been a couple days since I attended day two of the IAM training,
but I've been a little busy taking that information and preparing for
our class' assessment of the school.

On day two, we went over modules 3 and 4 (available at the `IATRP
website <http://www.iatrp.com/iam.cfm>`_, for those interested) and did
an actual assessment of our example organization's security posture and
delivered a final report. We addressed three areas our customer was
concerned most with, Networking/Connectivity, System Assurance, and
Physical Environment. We made up a couple of concerns that such an
organization would have, like not having backup connectivity at remote
sites or ACLs and firewalls protecting internet facing systems.

Here's a copy of the assessment plan outline
(`nts450\_day\_2.pdf <http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/nts450_day_2.pdf>`_)
and the information we gathered throughout the IAM process.
