title: Farewell Tomcat, Hello JSF!

Farewell Tomcat, Hello JSF!
###########################

Alright, so the US Navy is marking this week as the end of line for the
F-14 Tomcat. The Tomcat has been showing its age, becoming more
expensive to maintain, and slowly being replaced by F/A-18 Super
Hornets. As sad as it is to finally see the Tomcat go, the F-35
Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter) will be excellent in conjunction
with the F/A-18's. Stealthy, super fast, and capable of supporting
multiple roles, the JSF will be used by the USAF, US Navy, and USMC. It
replaces the F-16, A-10, and AV-8 Harrier jumpjet. That's right, it is
STOVL aircraft! Not only that, but there's talks of the USAF and USMC
variants to have `directed-energy
weapons <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed-energy_weapon>`_,
including solid-state lasers in the future and microwave beams. F-ing
badass!

This week the `Pratt & Whitney
F-135 <http://www.pratt-whitney.com/prod_mil_f135.asp>`_ completed its
`first series of engine
runs <http://www.pratt-whitney.com/pr_092006.asp>`_.. Congrats Pratt!
The F-135, a derivative of the F-119 engine powering the F-22A Raptor
delivers 40,000 lbs of thrust, more than any other military jet fighter
engine. It was awesome to be a part of such a great company..
