title: Day 1 of NSA's IAM

Day 1 of NSA's IAM
##################

The IAM training has been going pretty well, even though it was just the
first day. Today, the class went over the intital contact and
pre-assessment phases. We defined the mission of our example
organization (our customer) and identified points of contact within the
company. Impact attributes (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
were defined as well as the impact ratings: high, medium and low. Using
these definitions, our group classed the organizational information
criticality into a matrix using the impact attributes and ratings.
Following, we identified information systems and modeled them after the
information criticality matrix. Finally, we described our customer's
system configuration and how information flows across the organization.

Day 2 should be even better, as we cover the actual on-site assessment
visit and final analysis phases.
