The Red Threat
##############

From attacking our cyber information infrastructure,

    *People's Liberation Army writings in recent years have called for
    the use of all means necessary, including -or particularly-
    information warfare, to support or advance their nation's
    interests.*\ *[`DoD's efforts to stave off nation-state cyberattacks
    begin with China <http://www.gcn.com/print/25_25/41716-1.html>`_\ ]*

and spies stealing F-16 engines and other sensitive military tech,

    *On a hot Florida day late in 2005, Ko-Suen "Bill" Moo was preparing
    for the endgame of a covert operation he'd been orchestrating for
    nearly two years... The cargo was costing him nearly $4 million, but
    it was worth it. He would clear $1 million in profit once he made
    the delivery to his clients, senior officials in the Chinese
    People's Liberation Army.*

    *Moo's package was an F110-GE-129 afterburning turbofan engine,
    built by General Electric to power America's latest F-16 fighter jet
    to speeds greater than Mach 2 (1500 mph).*

    *...58-year-old Moo told the arms dealers who had arranged the
    purchase that he would soon be looking for additional engines--or
    even an entire F-16. But what the Chinese army wanted most of all
    was an AGM-129A, the U.S. Air Force's air-launched strategic
    nuclear-capable cruise missile. The stealth weapon, which flies at
    800 miles per hour, can deliver a 150-kiloton W80 warhead to a
    target 1800 miles away. [`How China Steals U.S. Military
    Secrets <http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/3319656.html>`_\ ]*

to now blinding U.S. satellites,

    *China has fired high-power lasers at U.S. spy satellites flying
    over its territory in what experts see as a test of Chinese ability
    to blind the spacecraft, according to sources.*

    *Pentagon officials, however, have kept quiet regarding China's
    efforts as part of a Bush administration policy to keep from
    angering Beijing, which is a leading U.S. trading partner and seen
    as key to dealing with onerous states like North Korea and Iran.
    [`China Attempts to Blind U.S. Satellites with
    Laser <http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=2121111&C=america>`_\ ]*

how far will America let China go before taking action? Does China even
have the right? According to treaty, a nation does not own the space
above their territory. God forbid they get testy one day and shoot one
down, it'd be 1962 all over again!
