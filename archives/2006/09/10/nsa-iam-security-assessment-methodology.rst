title: NSA IAM... Security Assessment Methodology

NSA IAM... Security Assessment Methodology
##########################################

This Tuesday and Wednesday I'll be attending a training session (held at
my school) on the `NSA's Infosec Assessment
Methodology <http://www.iatrp.com/iam.cfm>`_ taught by Russ Rogers and
Greg Miles of `Security Horizon <http://www.securityhorizon.com/>`_. The
IAM is a vunerability assessment of an organization's security posture,
and NOT a risk/threat assessmen. The IEM (Infosec Evaluation
Methodology) and Red Teaming cover the actual penetration testing... the
good stuff. But we'll see how this goes. I've read a couple chapters
from Greg and Russ' book and already learned a lot about the contracting
and pre-assessment phases. Should be interesting, I'll keep you all
posted.
