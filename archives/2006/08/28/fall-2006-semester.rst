title: Fall 2006 Semester

Fall 2006 Semester
##################

I've enrolled in the following classes this coming Fall semester (summer
just went by too quick), and would like to hear your input on them. I'm
including the professor's names in addition, since one class with
different instructors is never the same.

-  LAW370 - Legal Issues for Electronic Media w/ Thomas Liffiton
-  MAT180 - Pre-Calculus w/ Dritan Zela
-  NTS450 - Security Assessment Methodology w/ Greg Miles
-  PHY110 - Physics w/ Jose Rosario

I'll be back in Arizona on September 5 (yes, the same day classes
start..) early in the morning. Flying out of BDL at 7AM and arriving in
PHX at 9AM.
