IBM to buy ISS
##############

No... not the International Space Station (for you Slashdotters...)

**ARMONK, NY & ATLANTA - 23 Aug 2006:** IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Internet
Security Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISSX) today announced the two companies
have entered into a definitive agreement for IBM to acquire Internet
Security Systems, Inc., a publicly held company based in Atlanta, Ga.,
in an all-cash transaction at a price of approximately $1.3 billion, or

I don't think IBM is making out good with this deal, ISS has been
dissapointing as of late. First, they take their IDS/IPS products and
roll them up into a single appliance (the Proventia). Thus discontinuing
support (by the phasing out) for your third party hardware running the
Network and Server Sensor products. And we all know the Michael Lynn
story and how ISS is supposedly leading edge in security research, by
hanging their employee out to dry to the likes of Cisco PR and lawyers.
It made them look like idiots, and I'm sure there's many customers out
there who are left with a bad taste after that whole ordeal.

We'll see what investors think tomorrow when the market opens. Because
in the end, that's the only thing that matters :rolleyes:
