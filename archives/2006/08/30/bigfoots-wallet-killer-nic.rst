Bigfoot's "Wallet-Killer" NIC
#############################

Everytime I see `Bigfoot's "Killer"
NIC <http://www.killernic.com/KillerNic/>`_ being mentioned on websites
and forums, I just have to laugh. It's got interesting features like:
bypassing the Windows TCP/IP stack and processing within the hardware,
and running embedded Linux that's accessible via console. It makes for
an cool toy to play with, but for $279.00, save your money!

Bottom line: You're better off just getting a faster internet
connection.
