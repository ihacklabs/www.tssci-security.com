My Last Day...
##############

Wow, summer went by quick! I remember the first day of my internship:
nervous, excited and no idea what to expect. I've learned a lot these
past couple months, an experience you just don't get from sitting in a
classroom. I met a lot of cool people who were fun to work with and
really knew their jobs well. I really look forward to any opportunities
that lie ahead for me, as this is only the beginning of a long road to
go.

Cheers to everyone I've worked with this summer, and hope to see you
again someday!
