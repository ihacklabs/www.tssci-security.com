Update on what I've been reading so far...
##########################################

I have trouble finishing books I start. For whatever reason, I struggle
through it.

I began reading *InfoSec Career Hacking: Sell Your Skillz, Not Your
Soul* before I flew home for the summer, and read up until the last
couple chapters and got bored with it. The book has multiple authors and
as a result is sometimes redundant. I had stopped reading at the section
that describes different kinds of attacks, as if the reader didn't know
(duh?).

It took me all summer to finish *`Silence on the
Wire <http://www.tssci-security.com/?p=6>`_*. I'm so glad I did because
it was an incredible book that gave an entirely new perspective of
security to me.

At the same time as *SotW*, I was reading *Black Ice: The Invisible
Threat of Cyberterrorism* by Dan Verton. I haven't finished it, but it
is a good book and will soon. It really touches base on the insecurities
of our nation's critical infrastructure and how disasterous an attack on
it would be to our economy. Really scary stuff!

I've also been reading *Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret
National Security Agency* by James Bamford. This has been a very
interesting book, but very long and small print. I'm absolutely
fascinated with cold-war intelligence and spy stories, but, not much of
a reader until recently, it's tough.

There's also another book, *S\*PAM \_KiNgS: The Real Story Behind the
High-Rolling Hucksters, Pushing Porn, Pills, and @\*#?% Enlargements*.
This has been a much easier read than the other titles. I've been able
to read half of it within the last week, which is pretty good given the
amount of time I've devoted to it.

So, in summary, here are the following books I hope to finish and post a
review of:

-  S\*PAM \_KiNgS
-  Black Ice
-  Body of Secrets (will take me a while to finish)

Then the programming books I plan on starting once I go back to school
(not even course books).... I need to learn scripting, and thought
reading *sed & awk* would be a good start before *Learning Perl*. I'm
not sure if I should read *Mastering Regular Expressions* in between,
it's probably overkill reading *sed & awk*. What are your opinions?
