title: Security Engineering...  for Free!!

Security Engineering...  for Free!!
###################################

I'm enthused to hear Ross Anderson has made his book, *Security
Engineering* available `online and FREE to
download <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html>`_. He explains his
reasoning at his
`website <http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2006/08/25/with-a-single-bound-it-was-free/>`_;
to reach the widest possible audience, especially among poor students
and being a supporter of free culture and free software.

I have no excuse now to read it, and actually cannot wait to get to it
that I am putting other books aside. I've heard so much about this book
lately, and when I get through it I will be buying a copy to keep within
reach. Thank you, Ross!
