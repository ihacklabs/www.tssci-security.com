title: The (In)Security of Locks

The (In)Security of Locks
#########################

Here's a cool article
[`engadget <http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/24/the-lockdown-locked-but-not-secure-part-i/>`_\ ],
from the lockpicking event at DEFCON14 in Las Vegas. The author goes
into some detail as to what the components of a lock are and how they
work together. Also described is the history of "bumping" locks (as the
11 year-old girl in the photo could do) and the insecurity of ping
tumbler locks.

The key pictured is from a Kwikset lock, a popular lock I've noticed in
different residences in Arizona.. o\_O . A friend and I were able to
pick his apartment lock in a matter of seconds using a street-sweeper
bristle we found!
