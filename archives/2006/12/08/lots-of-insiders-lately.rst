Lots of "Insiders" Lately..
###########################

I've noticed a lot of
`discussion <http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/07/2339228>`_
around
`news <http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/insider_identit_1.html>`_\ (some
`new <http://www.varbusiness.com/sections/news/breakingnews.jhtml?articleId=196602482>`_,
some `old <http://news.com.com/2100-1029_3-6137940.html>`_) articles
this week related to "increased insider threats".

To quote my own Slashdot
`post <http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=210590&cid=17159996>`_:

    "Viktor Cherkashin, a former KGB officer states in his book *Spy
    Handler*, people most often commit treason based on personal needs
    that need to be resolved, right now. Most commonly financial
    reasons, it is why Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen both defected to
    spy for Soviets.

    What's the ideal solution? Make your employees happy, pay them more,
    etc? It's difficult to stop good people from going rogue, and even
    worse doing pre-screening. Note even a single scope background
    investigation and polygraph works (see above)

    And to quote Cherkashin, "The only way to be safe is to remove
    people from intelligence gathering, ....as long as people are
    involved, security threats can never be completely eliminated."

It is true, to remove the human element would eliminate many security
risks. With a sound process and security architecture, we can work
towards reducing this risk. Things like proper delegation of authority,
peer review, and even conversation helps.

You all know how pissed off people can get when they lose a game, now
imagine getting fired?! That one person shouldn't have the ability to do
so much damage in the first place. At the company I interned over the
summer, not even the core IT Security people had administrator rights on
their own workstations...
