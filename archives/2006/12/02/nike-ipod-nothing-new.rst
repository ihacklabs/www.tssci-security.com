Nike + Ipod... nothing new
##########################

I've been seeing
`stories <http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/11803/>`_
about the Nike+Ipod sport kit and how researchers have come up with a
way to track people wearing them. This is nothing new, people have been
able to do this for quite some time, called SIGINT (signals
intelligence). You've been carrying around a personal tracking device
since (at least) the early 90's, called a cell phone.
