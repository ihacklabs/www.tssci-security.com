My Security Predictions of 2007
###############################

Following everyone else and their "`Security Predictions of
2007 <http://del.icio.us/anton18/security+predictions+2007>`_," I have
some predictions of my own:

#. I will be graduating in August with a Bachelor's Degree
#. I will be looking for an entry-level position in security

These are two predictions that I am 100% positive of for the year 2007.
In reply to `Mike
Rothman <http://securityincite.com/blog/mike-rothman/the-daily-incite-december-15-2006#tsn2>`_,
`Mike
Murray <http://www.episteme.ca/index.php?/archives/194-The-Security-Talent-War.html>`_,
and the recent news articles reporting there's not much new security
talent for hire, well... I hope that I can contribute my skills
somewhere out there.
