Games for Security Geeks
########################

For those who know me personally, will know I have barely any time for
games. I always say that us network security geeks shouldn't be playing
games, leave that to the smelly game design kids (j/k with ya guys).
Well, here are a couple games I do approve of playing, *`The Evolving
Threat <http://www.iss.net/evolvingthreat/game.html>`_* from IBM/ISS,
*`Arm Yourself Against
Attacks <http://spe.atdmt.com/ds/NMMRTUMISITP/ITSecDec/mrs06292_aste_336x800.swf?ver=1&clickTag1=http://clk.atdmt.com/go/ntroiitp0170000023mrt/direct;ai.19709962;ct.1/01&clickTag=http://clk.atdmt.com/go/ntroiitp0170000023mrt/direct;ai.19709962;ct.1/01>`_*
from Microsoft, and *`Invisible
Burglar <http://www.emea.symantec.com/invisibleburglar/>`_*\ by
Symantec.

The Evolving Threat is fun, but watch out for "spyware" and "designer
malware", I couldn't seem to kill them so I just go into hyperspace..
enjoy
