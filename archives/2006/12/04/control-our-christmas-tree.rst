title: Control our Christmas Tree :)

Control our Christmas Tree :)
#############################

A couple students at my school hacked our Christmas tree. You can
`control it <http://168.158.222.131/index.html>`_. You'll have to
open up two browser windows to view the cameras and control it
simultaneously(to prevent abuse). It's been featured on
`Make <http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/12/control_a_web_e.html>`_
and some more pictures
`here <http://shockyou.blogspot.com/2006/12/uatree.html>`_. The web
server is hosting the the web page on a PINK Ethernet module. You can
turn the lights on/off and scroll them as well. Have fun with it, but
please don't abuse it.
