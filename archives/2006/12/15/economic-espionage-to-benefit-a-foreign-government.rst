title: Economic Espionage to Benefit a Foreign Government

Economic Espionage to Benefit a Foreign Government
##################################################

A new case in my coverage of espionage stories, the `Houston
Chronicle <http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4403876.html>`_ is
reporting this time a Chinese engineer working in Silicon Valley is
indicted on 36 felony counts, including economic espionage to benefit a
foreign government and various military export control regulations.

    Xiaodong Sheldon Meng, 42, a Chinese national with Canadian
    citizenship... Prosecutors say Meng stole the code for software made
    by his former employer, Quantum3D Inc., that's used to train
    military fighter pilots, and tried to sell it to the Royal Thai Air
    Force, the Royal Malaysian Air Force and a company with ties to
    China's military.

    Under U.S. law, anyone attempting to sell such information overseas
    must first obtain a license from the State Department and is subject
    to strict regulations. Meng never applied for such a license.

    Meng's case marks only the third time in a decade prosecutors have
    charged someone with economic espionage to benefit a foreign
    government, the most serious crime under the Economic Espionage Act
    of 1996. A conviction carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in
    prison.

In another, unrelated case, two other engineers pleaded guilty Thursday
to stealing proprietary computer chip designs from four technology
companies and attempting to smuggle them to China.

    Fei Ye, 40, a U.S. citizen from China, and Ming Zhong, 39, a
    permanent resident of the U.S. from China, pleaded guilty in San
    Jose federal court to two counts each of economic espionage to
    benefit a foreign government as part of a deal with prosecutors. Ye
    and Zhong initially faced 10 counts each, and had been scheduled to
    go to trial in January.

    Ye and Zhong were arrested in 2001 at San Francisco International
    Airport, attempting to board a flight to China. Their luggage was
    allegedly crammed with thousands of pages of trade secrets stolen
    from four Silicon Valley companies \_ NEC Electronics Corp., Sun
    Microsystems Inc., Transmeta Corp. and Trident Microsystems Inc.

    Both said little during Thursday's 40-minute hearing, and afterward
    declined to comment through their defense lawyers.

    Ye and Zhong, who remain free on bail following their pleas, are
    scheduled to be sentenced April 23. Each face a maximum of 30 years
    in prison.
