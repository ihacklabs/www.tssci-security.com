Open Letter to Domain Registrars
################################

Get right down to it! F-Secure has posted this
`letter <http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-122006.html#00001041>`_
asking domain registrars to double-check the names people register for
domains to help combat phishing. The example they give is just one of
many that go wild:

    Like, say, somebody trying to register a .com domain with the words
    "ebay" and "sign in" in it? Isn't it pretty obvious that something
    might be going on here?

    You see, yesterday somebody did just that.

    Mr. "Craig Smith" from Kilwinning in the UK registered a domain name
    called "signin-ebay-c.com" with directNIC. Right now, he's running a
    phishing site on it...

    ...you can contact Mr. Smith at the phone number he left in his
    registration data: 1231432311. That sounds pretty real. I'm sure his
    credit card is his own, too.

Hopefully we get a response soon, and see what the registrars have to
say. It'd be nice to not have to deal with the many phishing sites there
are today by simply not allowing registration of domain names. Not only
that, but the fact that the domain name infringes on Ebay's trademark.
