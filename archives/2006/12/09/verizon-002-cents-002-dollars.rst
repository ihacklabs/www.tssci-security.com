title: Verizon, .002 cents != .002 dollars

Verizon, .002 cents != .002 dollars
###################################

Yikes, the reps at Verizon need to be trained in elementary mathematics.
`George Vaccaro definitely has more patience than I
do. <http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/>`_

Best quote in the `audio
clip <http://media.putfile.com/Verizon-Bad-Math>`_ at ~15:33

    ... **Andrea:** What do you mean .002 dollars? **George:** Do you
    recognize that there's a difference between one dollar and one cent?
    **Andrea:** definitely **George:** Do you recognize that there's a
    difference between half a dollar and half a cent? **Andrea:**
    definitely **George:** Then, do you therefore recognize that there's
    a difference between .002 dollars and .002 cents? **Andrea:** No.
    **George:** No? **Andrea:** I mean, there's, there's no no .002
    dollars... **George:** Of course there is **Andrea:** .002 cents is
    what you're quoted...... blah blah blah

This is fucking hilarious, sad and frustrating all at the same time.
Posted under intelligence for lack thereof.

Edit 12/10/2006: `Response from Verizon - 100% Refund - .002%
Concession <http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/2006/12/response-from-verizon-100-refund.html>`_

Nice to see they resolved the issue, now to just update their reps on
the pricing

    Dear George Vaccaro,

    Thank you for your reply. Again, I apologize for the
    miscommunications regarding this issue and for your frustration and
    inconvenience as a result.

    In review of your account a previous representative has credited for
    the data charges in question for $71.79. You may take this amount
    off of your current amount due. In the future please keep in mind
    that it is .002 dollars per KB while in Canada.

    It has been a pleasure assisting you today, and we appreciate your
    business. Have a wonderful week!

    Sincerely,

    Michelle Verizon Wireless Customer Service
