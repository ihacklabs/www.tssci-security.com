title: Breach and The Good Shepherd

Breach and The Good Shepherd
############################

On Christmas, I went to the movie theaters and saw `The Good
Shepherd <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/>`_. I liked it, but felt
that the romance with Angelina Jolie and family issues took away from
it. It did a good job showing how family and relationships are affected
by secretive lives, but I didn't care too much for that. I wanted more
thriller, like `Spy Game <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266987/>`_ (which
I can watch repeatedly), even though it is less realistic.

I love watching the trailers before the movies, and was absolutely
ecstatic when I saw the preview for
`Breach <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401997/>`_, begin with "You're
going to be an agent... You're being tasked to headquarters, where
you'll be riding the desk of an agent named Robert Hanssen." I recently
finished reading *Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer - The true story
of the man who recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames.* In the book,
Victor Cherkashin detailed how brilliant Hanssen was and how well he
managed to conduct himself as a double agent. I'm looking forward to
this movie, and I hope the "Hollywood romance" is kept to a minimum.
