title: BS ThreatCon Levels

BS ThreatCon Levels
###################

Who else besides me thinks "ThreatCon" levels are bullshit? (not to be
confused with vulnerability alerts) After checking out Slashdot this
morning, I came across `CERTStation <http://www.certstation.com/>`_,
which attempts to aggregate current threat information into one page,
entirely in Flash. I won't get into how much Flash sites irritate me, as
we can debate for days and not get anywhere on it. Who knows what the
site's true purpose is, selling you information in exchange for money or
personal information? who knows..

But let's talk about threat levels. Why is it that A/V vendors tend to
have elevated levels than anyone else? How do they determine these
threat levels? Current number of infected machines, virus propagation
time? For real now, who really acts differently when all of a sudden the
threat level goes from green to yellow, or yellow to orange? Not to
mention, the colors don't mean anything to me! What exactly is
threatening me that I need to be more alert? Is it a new worm or exploit
code that affects 99% of business systems? Come on, tell me! This is why
I tend to be "always on alert," which would equate to the color red. I
am always thinking there will be something out there that will cause
havoc for me so whatever that is, I want to be prepared for it. Staying
on top of the latest vulnerabilities, identifying and analyzing the ones
that affect me I can determine what is critical and what is not.

This is what ThreatCon Levels mean to me:
