F-35 Finishes Taxi Tests
########################

The JSF (I like JSF better than F-35 Lightning II), has completed all
its taxi tests this week. I had the incredible opportunity of interning
at Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturer of the F-135 turbofan.. and I have
to say I'm a fanboy. I love these two aircraft, and can't wait to see
the JSF in action! Check out Lockheed's `press
release <http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&ci=18074&rsbci=1&fti=129&ti=0&sc=400>`_
and `Team JSF <http://images.teamjsf.com/main.php>`_ for more photos.
