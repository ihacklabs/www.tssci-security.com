`NIST <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/>`_ has released
`SP800-100 <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-100/sp800-100.pdf>`_,
Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers. I'm sure it'd
benefit everyone in the security community, since you either are or one
day will be a manager (or at least help make managers make more informed
decisions). Here's a quick run down on the sections it covers:

    #. Introduction
    #. Information Security Governance
    #. System Development Life Cycle
    #. Awareness and Training
    #. Capital Planning and Investment Control
    #. Interconnecting Systems
    #. Performance Measures
    #. Security Planning
    #. Information Technology Contingency Planning
    #. Risk Management
    #. Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments
    #. Security Services and Products Acquisition
    #. Incident Response
    #. Configuration Management
