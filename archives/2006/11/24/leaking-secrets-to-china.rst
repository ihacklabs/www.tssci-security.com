title: Leaking Secrets to China

Leaking Secrets to China
########################

China's at it again, this time having obtained information on secret
technology used on the B-2 stealth bomber's engines. The data will now
allow China to copy or counter weapons using the technology.

    Details of the classified defense technology related to the B-2's
    engine exhaust system and its ability to avoid detection by infrared
    sensors were sold to Chinese officials by former defense contractor
    Noshir S. Gowadia, an Indian-born citizen charged with spying in a
    federal indictment released by prosecutors in Hawaii.

The stealth technology isn't the only thing Noshir gave the Chinese,
having assisted in developing a missile exhaust system that is hard to
detect by radar and helped modify a cruise missile to intercept U.S.
air-to-air missiles. In 2002 and 2004, Noshir sent emails containing
SECRET and TOP SECRET data to Israel, Germany and Switzerland. It is
suspected he's given classified information to as many as eight foreign
nations, and has been paid as much as $2 million.
