Export U.S. Defense Information to China - Fun for the whole family!
####################################################################

`Information
Week <http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193502101&cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All>`_
is reporting a story involving a family of five, who await a hearing for
charges of conspiring to export U.S. defense information to China.

    Chi Mak, 66, of Downey, Calif., was an engineer with Power Paragon,
    a Navy contractor. He allegedly collected technical information
    about U.S. warship technologies, and then he and his wife, Rebecca
    Laiwah Chiu, copied it onto CD-ROMs. According to the U.S.
    Department of Justice, another family member then allegedly
    encrypted the defense data in preparation for a "surreptitious
    delivery" to the People's Republic of China.
    A report from the DOJ contends that Chi Mak received ''task lists''
    that requested specific defense-related information, including
    information on Naval research into nuclear-powered submarines.

The sad fact is there are many, many more incidents like this happening
that go unnoticed.
