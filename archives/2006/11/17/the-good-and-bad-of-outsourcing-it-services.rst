title: The Good and Bad of Outsourcing IT Services

The Good and Bad of Outsourcing IT Services
###########################################

If investing into an IT services company is something you are interested
in, Morningstar published their `Picks Among U.S. IT Service
Providers <http://news.morningstar.com/article/article.asp?id=179063&pgid=wwhome1a>`_.
Great for the personal investor looking to make a couple bucks in their
trading account, but if you're a business-decision-maker-type-of-person
at any company, just hold it right there. Whatever you do, do not sell
off your IT infrastructure to an outsourcing firm! You will never get
those resources back when you finally realize you would have been better
off without them. Add to the series, the outsource firm's processes and
office politics on top of your own company's policies and processes.
Then try and tell me how tough it is to get something done...

If your company has outsourced IT services, let me know how it's been
going so far. In addition, include the firm and where they are located
if you'd like.
