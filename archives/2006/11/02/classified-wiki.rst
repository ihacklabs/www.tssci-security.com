Classified Wiki?
################

The U.S. intelligence community recently unveiled Intellipedia, a
top-secret wiki available to sixteen various agencies to share
information and resources better. You can catch more on the story at
`GCN <http://www.gcn.com/print/25_29/42090-1.html>`_,
`Infowars <http://www.infowars.com/articles/bb/internet_us_intel_unveils_spy_version_wikipedia.htm>`_,
and a blog dedicated to
`Intellipedia <http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/>`_!

My concern is information that was once compartmentalized, giving those
with a need to know access, now makes 28,000 pages available to over
3,600 registered users. Three points need to be met before you are given
access to classified information:

-  Clearance (do you have the correct level of clearance?)
-  Access (have you been given access to this information?)
-  Need to know (and finally, do you need to know this information to do
   your job?)

On the other hand, making information this "available", could help
improve the accuracy and timeliness of reports now that the information
has more eyes reviewing it. It definitely is a compromise, between
having information confidential and having it available.

Hopefully this system will help our intelligence community make better,
more informed decisions with regards to our national security.
