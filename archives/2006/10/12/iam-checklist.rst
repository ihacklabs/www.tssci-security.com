IAM Checklist
#############

I've been getting some requests for what to look for when doing the
on-site portion of an INFOSEC assessment, and put together a checklist
derived from the 18 baseline classes and categories the NSA has
specified. You can add/remove to this list as you like, it's by no means
"the" checklist as you'll find out in your own environment.

You can download a PDF
`here <http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/iam_checklist.pdf>`_.
