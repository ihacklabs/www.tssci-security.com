Slackware 11.0
##############

Pat unleashed `Slackware 11.0 <http://www.slackware.com>`_ tonight, with
an `official
announcement <http://www.slackware.com/announce/11.0.php>`_. Xfce
4.2.3.2, a lightweight and fast desktop environment is now available
along with KDE. Still included is the tried and true 2.4.33.3 kernel,
with an available 2.6.17.13 or 2.6.18 kernel in /testing. Here's a `mini
changelog <http://www.slackware.com/announce/changes11.0.php>`_
detailing some of the changes from 10.2 to 11.0, including what packages
have been added or removed, and other changes that would explain why
you're stuck.

Be sure to get the ISO's through
`BitTorrent <http://www.slackware.com/getslack/torrents.php>`_, and seed
while you can.
