title: N Korea Conducts Nuclear Test

N Korea Conducts Nuclear Test
#############################

According to `news
sources <http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/10/09/korea.nuclear.test/index.html>`_,
the
`USGS <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/ustqab.php>`_
in its `seismic
activity <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Maps/10/130_40.php>`_
study, claims North Korea has conducted a nuclear test. At the moment,
the Pentagon is working to confirm these claims, the South Korean stocks
drop like rocks on their stock exchange, and Japan is setting up a task
force to assess the situation.

We'll see what comes of this in the coming hours...
