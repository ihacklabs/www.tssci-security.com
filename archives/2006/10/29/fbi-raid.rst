FBI Raid
########

Remember the college student who had a website that allowed you to
create fake boarding passes to get past TSA security checkpoints at the
airport? Well, according to `his
blog <http://slightparanoia.blogspot.com/>`_, the FBI raided his home
and left a warrant and a list of items for seizure (anything that could
have been used in making his website, buying airline tickets, and any
other documents regarding airport security).

That was quick... it's unfortunate nobody sees the weaknesses in airport
security, and how it's all just a show (aka "security theater") until
events like these take place. Here is an excellent
`post <http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=203310&cid=16627962>`_ on
Slashdot regarding knowing what the bad guys know.
