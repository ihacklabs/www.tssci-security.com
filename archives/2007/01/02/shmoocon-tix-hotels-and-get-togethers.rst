ShmooCon Tix, Hotels, and Meets
###############################

I couldn't take it anymore, so I bit the bullet and bought a ticket to
`ShmooCon <http://www.shmoocon.org/>`_ for $150. Next thing I need to
arrange are hotel accommodations. Wardman Park Marriott is too expensive
for us poor college students, so I'll be looking into getting a room
somewhere else for cheap. Luickly, Shmoo created the
`ShmooCon-roommate <http://lists.shmoo.com/mailman/listinfo/shmoocon-roommates>`_
mailing list for people looking to save some $$$ on their stay in
Washington D.C.. March will be fast approaching and the sooner things
are taken care of, the better.

Once a schedule is posted up (sometime in February), it'd be cool to
arrange a get-together of attending bloggers from Security Bloggers
Network. Who's interested?
