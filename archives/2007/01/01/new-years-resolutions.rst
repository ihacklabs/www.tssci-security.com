New Year's Resolutions
######################

Happy New Year everyone! I had a great night with my friends and a lot
of unneeded drama, but oh well. I'm disappointed I wasn't able to snag
ShmooCon tickets for $75; they sold out in under three minutes! I'm
still organizing a trip with several other students from my school, I
just need to know who's definitely in and who's not. E-mail me if you
are *truly* interested.

We had "Predictions of 2007," let's hear some Resolutions! I made some
New Year's resolutions for 2007 and I hope to keep them this time. Here
are a couple of mine:

#. Finish books I start. During a semester I will be reading anywhere
   from 5-10 books. I hope to do this by reading one chapter per week
   per book. [I have no idea how, but `Richard
   Bejtlich <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/12/favorite-books-i-read-and-reviewed-in.html>`_
   from TaoSecurity reads so many books (52 in 2006); hopefully he can
   give some tips! **edit:** *Ask and we shall
   `receive <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/01/reading-tips.html>`_...that
   was quick, thanks Richard!*]
#. Rid myself of Windows dependence! Currently I run Windows XP Pro on
   my workstation, Ubuntu on my laptop, and Slackware on my home server.
   I will run Slackware as my desktop OS and also turn an Alpha
   Workstation (thanks Chad!) into an OpenBSD server.
#. Live securely. Ideas from
   `Bejtlich <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/12/starting-out-in-digital-security.html>`_
   again, how many of you do not always practice what you preach? To
   whoever is running Windows at home, does YOUR user account have
   administrator privileges? I don't know how people will take this (I
   want to hear your opinions), but I will admit my Windows user account
   had administrator privileges. I don't see it so much as hypocrisy but
   because I have just been too lazy and frustrated with programs that
   require them.
#. Live healthy and continue exercising daily. In 2006, I lost 32lbs and
   feel 100x better than I ever did before. I find my energy throughout
   the day is greater when I eat well, exercise and get enough sleep. I
   can free my mind and take out some aggression at the gym and I think
   more clearly than I did before. My advice to anyone looking to lose
   weight this year, eat healthy and divide food into portions. Abs are
   made in the kitchen, and like anything else in life, too much of a
   good thing is bad for you.

Let's hear some of your resolutions, and again, Happy New Year and I
hope 2007 will be even better than last year for everyone. :)
