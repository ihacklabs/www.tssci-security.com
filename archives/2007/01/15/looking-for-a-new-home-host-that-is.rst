Looking for a new home... host that is
######################################

The time is nearing and I will have to move my site to a new host. Along
with the move, we'll undergo a domain name change to
*www.tssci-security.com* as well. Currently we're hosted on a dedicated
FreeBSD server running Apache, and I'm pretty happy with it. I'd like a
host that offers UNIX/Linux and SSH access and doesn't force me use
those pesky management panels (except for phpMyAdmin) or anything like
that..

Can anyone recommend a hosting provider or perhaps have room to spare on
their server and is interested in subletting? Also, I'd like to hear
your opinions on dynamic DNS providers like
`No-IP <http://www.no-ip.com/>`_, `DynDNS <http://dyndns.com/>`_ and
`FreeDNS <http://freedns.afraid.org/>`_. Shoot me an email or comment
here.
