A.. A... A... Availability!!!
#############################

Guy Kawasaki has a very interesting blog and today posted "`The top 10
stupid ways to hinder market
adoption. <http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/01/the_top_ten_stu.html>`_\ "

    14. Supporting only Windows Internet Explorer.

What Guy fails to mention, is having a website that's always available
to its users. Supporting only IE makes websites unavailable to many
users who use other browsers. It's part of the CIA triangle,
Confidentiality - Integrity - **Availability**. Availability is key to
creating a successful (online) business, and every minute a site is
unavailable or responding slowly, that's lost business. For a company
that's trying to create a market, sending out press releases with links
to their products and only to arrive to a dead link or downed website...
good bye.

While I'm on the topic of availability, Michael Farnum
`expresses <http://infosecplace.com/blog/2007/01/27/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability/>`_
some frustration with a security research company and Microsoft about a
vulnerability that affects the stability of Internet Explorer. Though
it's not a critical vulnerability, having malformed code crash your
browser is unamusing.
