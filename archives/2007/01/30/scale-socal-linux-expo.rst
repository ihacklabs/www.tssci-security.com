SCALE: SoCal Linux Expo
#######################

Literally right after RSA, `SCALE <http://socallinuxexpo.com/scale5x/>`_
is happening February 10th and 11th. I plan on making the drive out with
several other friends from school.

The presentations I'm looking forward to:

-  New & Improved: How a More Modern IT Security Model Can Better
   Protect Enterprise Data on Linux Systems
-  Proving End-to-End Security in a Linux Environment
-  Web Applications: What is your backup/recovery plan?
-  Open Source Network Management Best Practices
-  How to monitor your infrastructure with Open Source software
-  Admin++, what root never told you
