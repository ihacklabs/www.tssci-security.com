title: Scope your efforts

Scope your efforts
##################

When contracted to perform a network security evaluation or penetration
test, one of the most important stages is the pre-evaluation phase.
During this phase, you develop contacts and gather information about the
company. It's important to determine the scope of your efforts with your
customer and sign an engagement agreement. In your contract, you square
away all legal issues concerning a security evaluation.

The scope defines the customer's mission, industry regulations in
effect, and most importantly their expecatations. Some companies may
want you to run vulnerability scanners, review security policies, or do
actual red team activities. It's important to communicate up front what
is expected. The scope also identifies customer constraints and
concerns. Politics or other concerns may prevent you from performing a
thorough evaluation, and/or limit you only to a certain set of systems.
I've encountered situations where the site being evaluated was well
secured, however a remote site was neglected and thus opend up a
vulnerability.

To avoid impact to the customer during peak operation times, you need to
reach an agreement on when the technical scanning and testing will be
conducted. Often this is during non-working hours, i.e., 8PM to 6AM. Let
the customer know what you plan on using to do to evaluate their
security. This can include commercial and open source tools, custom
scripts, etc. In addition, some customers may have had negative
experiences with certain evaluation tools and will not want them run on
their network. Document these concerns and include them in your report.

One last thing: never assume anything! You wouldn't want to arrive at a
customer site only to discover it's an IPX network and you only brought
tools that work on TCP/IP.
