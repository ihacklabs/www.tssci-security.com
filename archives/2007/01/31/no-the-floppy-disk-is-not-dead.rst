title: No, the floppy disk is not dead

No, the floppy disk is not dead
###############################

My staging servers cannot boot from CD-ROM, therefore I use a boot disk.
For this reason alone, I have floppy drives in all my systems. I also
save time by booting from floppy disk and installing operating systems
over the network. A tip for anyone who's looking to become RHCE
certified: install RHEL using a network connection because it's much,
much faster than installing via CD and it saves precious time during
your performance based exam.

How does this impact the security of your systems? How does this affect
available network bandwidth? Ideally, we don't want to introduce more
entry points into our systems than we need, be it via USB drive, floppy,
or CD-ROM. Which do you prefer, or do you even care?
