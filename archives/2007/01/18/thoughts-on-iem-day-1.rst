title: Thoughts on IEM Day 1

Thoughts on IEM Day 1
#####################

I was tired today.. maybe it was the material, or the fact that I had to
break my college routine and wake up early in the morning... but I was
beat. Regarding the IEM, the material could be a little better. Some of
the tools that were mentioned are not used so much today, but the
methodology still applies. NSA doesn't endorse any of the tools, but to
be an IEM, requires you use tools to complete several baseline
activities I'll list below.

The nice thing about the IAM and IEM is that it provides a "repeatable
framework" for security assessments and evaluations. Each organization
is different, so it's up to the security people performing the
evaluation to gather up their skill sets and use what works for them for
their particular environment.

There are 10 baseline activities that an evaluation covers:

#. Port Scanning
#. SNMP Scanning
#. Enumeration & Banner Grabbing
#. Wireless Enumeration
#. Vulnerability Scanning
#. Host Evaluation
#. Network Device Analysis
#. Password Compliance Testing
#. Application Specific Scanning
#. Network Sniffing

Most of the activities are pretty basic, and knowing how to use your
tools effectively will make all the difference. I realized I haven't
done much with SNMP, and I can also work on improving my skills with
netcat. We didn't do anything with wireless, since we were on an
isolated LAN segment.

If you want more information on the IEM or IAM, check out
`IATRP <http://www.iatrp.com/iem.cfm>`_. You can also view the
presentation slides used during the lectures.
