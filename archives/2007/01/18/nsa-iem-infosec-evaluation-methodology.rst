NSA IEM: INFOSEC Evaluation Methodology
#######################################

This semester, I am taking the IEM as part of a class that will be
assigned to evaluate my university's network security. Last semester, I
was a team leader in an
`IAM <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2006/09/10/nsa-iam-security-assessment-methodology/>`_,
an
`assessment <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2006/09/13/day-1-of-nsas-iam/>`_
of my school's organizational information security. The IAM is `two full
days <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2006/09/15/iam-day-2/>`_,
as well as the IEM. I am taking classes through `Security
Horizon <http://www.securityhorizon.com>`_, co-founded by Russ Rogers
and Greg Miles, who wrote the books on `NSA
IAM <http://www.amazon.com/Security-Assessment-Case-Studies-Implementing/dp/1932266968/sr=8-1/qid=1169134549/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-1930007-5410041?ie=UTF8&s=books>`_
and `NSA

I'll post my thoughts throughout the day and after today's training
session. In the meantime, you can see
