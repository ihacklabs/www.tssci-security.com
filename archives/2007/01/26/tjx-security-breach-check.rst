TJX security breach.. check
###########################

I am not 100% positive or if this just merely coincidence, but I have a
feeling my sister has fallen victim to the TJX security breach reported
last week. Fraudulent transactions originating in France (of all places)
began January 10th, comprosing four withdrawls: $3.90, $1.30, $.04, and
$.01. Finally, $120 was debited and my sister caught on and took action.

One of the reasons I like online banking is because it allows me to
review my statement (to-date) whenever I need too. I do not have to wait
until the end of the month to receive the statement, and had my sister
checked her statement online routinely, the last charge may never have
happened. I hope no sensitive personal information was exposed besides
the bank account numbers.
