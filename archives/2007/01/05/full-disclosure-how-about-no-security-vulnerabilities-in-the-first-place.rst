Full disclosure: How about no security vulnerabilities in the first place?
##########################################################################

Michael (LV) over at
`terminal23 <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/01/full_disclosure_it_makes_us_st.html>`_
hits the nail right on the head with the latest
`articles <http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=113737>`_ and
`blog <http://www.matasano.com/log/660/month-of-versiontracker-bugs/>`_
`posts <http://ryanlrussell.blogspot.com/2007/01/vulnerability-pimps.html>`_
regarding full disclosure and responsible disclosure. I'd rather hear
from the community about a new security vulnerability than wait for a
vendor to respond and come up with a fix. All the while that same
vulnerability could already be being exploited by somebody else. When I
know about a new security vulnerability, be it a 0day or one that's
still unpatched, I can at least plan on using other layers (you are
practicing defense in depth, aren't you?) of security to mitigate it.

Even better, would be for everyone to stop researching security
vulnerabilities all together... black hats, white hats, you name it! But
then, we'd all have to find a new career.. and it's a totally
unrealistic goal right from the start. There will always be someone
finding security holes, and if one "responsible" researcher can find
one, you can bet there is someone else that knows as well, with an
entirely different intent.

These latest discussions reminds me of the
`controversy <http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,68328,00.html>`_
with Michael Lynn, Cisco and Black Hat back in 2005. My favorite is this
quote from `Schneier's
blog <http://schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/07/cisco_harasses.html>`_:

    Full disclosure is good for society. But because it helps the bad
    guys as well as the good guys (see my essay on `secrecy and
    security <http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0205.html#1>`_ for
    more discussion of the balance), many of us have championed
    "`responsible
    disclosure <http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0203.html#2>`_\ "
    guidelines that give vendors a head start in fixing vulnerabilities
    before they're announced.
    The problem is that not all researchers follow these guidelines. And
    laws limiting free speech do more harm to society than good. (In any
    case, laws won't completely fix the problem; we can't get laws
    passed in every possible country security researchers live.) **So
    the only reasonable course of action for a company is to work with
    researchers who alert them to vulnerabilities, but also assume that
    vulnerability information will sometimes be released without prior
    warning.**

A colleague of mine once compared Michael Lynn and responsible
disclosure to the medical/pharmaceutical industry. It's not always the
case, but I find the comparison insightful; I would like to hear any
research a doctor has about an Rx with potentially dangerous,
undisclosed side effects... wouldn't anybody?
