SANS Certifications, GSEC anyone?
#################################

As some of you know, I should be (hopefully) graduating this August.
I'll be taking a couple classes this summer to finish up the credits I
need and finally graduate. I've been thinking more and more about some
entry-level security certifications but am not sure whether it would be
worth pursuing right now.

What do you guys think of the `SANS GIAC Security Essentials
Certification <http://www.giac.org/certifications/security/gsec.php>`_
(GSEC)? I know certifications are a hit or miss with many people, and a
lot of certifications seem to be worth less than the paper they are
printed on. Any advice to a graduating college student and taking the
certification path, and to anyone whose taken the test, what study
materials do you recommend?

I'd like to finish this post by congratulating `Martin
McKeay <http://www.mckeay.net/secure/2007/01/i_am_now_sans_gsna_certified.html>`_
for earning his `SANS GIAC Systems and Network
Auditor <http://www.giac.org/certifications/audit/gsna.php>`_ (GSNA)
certification. Way to go! :)
