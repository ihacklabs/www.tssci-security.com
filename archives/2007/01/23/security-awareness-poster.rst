Security Awareness Poster..
###########################

I made this poster back a couple years ago, telling users to think
before they click. It shows a mouse pointer and "Format C:\\" button
with a red circle and a slash through it. (**edit:** click
`here <http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/clicknix.png>`_
for the \*nix version) If anyone has some other sayings for it (I'm not
great at coming up with catchy phrases), comment and I'll post a version
of that poster.

Give it to your corporate bindery and have copies printed off and hang
them around. :)
