title: Storm-Worm and F-Secure WorldMap

Storm-Worm and F-Secure WorldMap
################################

F-Secure has a `replay <http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001087>`_ of
their WorldMap from last night, 01/19/2007. It shows the spread of
Storm-Worm Small.DAM, an e-mail worm and it's really, really cool. I
want one! (not the worm of course, :P )

The video is also available on
`YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH8cS1AkqiI>`_.
