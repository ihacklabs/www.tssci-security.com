This is horrible, this idea: "Phishing your own users"
######################################################

I see Michael Farnum has
`responded <http://infosecplace.com/blog/2007/01/08/phishing-your-own-users/>`_
to Terry Sweeney's `blog
post <http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=113074>`_ on
`Phishing your own
users <http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=113055>`_. I would
just like to remind everyone that while intentions may be good, to
remember the times people have tried this tactic with viruses. How many
times did we hear about someone writing a virus that removes viruses or
one that enables a *security* feature? Or how about testing the
effectiveness of an anti-virus solution by distributing to users a file
(containing a virus) that says "DO\_NOT\_OPEN\_ME" ? **Edit:** see `How
not stop a virus
attack <http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/24/44OPrecord_1.html>`_.

I feel there are much better ways to measure the effectiveness of your
security awareness training. In my opinion, this method of testing users
by fake phishing will only confuse them. A couple suggestions for
measuring effectiveness:

-  Question and answer testing
-  Spot the fake
-  A "What would you do?"

Simply coming up with a test would be a much better and less riskier way
to measure results than seeing who clicks on your phishing scam and who
doesn't. To sum it up, I edited a quote from one of the best movies ever
made: `Office Space <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/>`_.

    **Tom**: What do you say we set up fake sites that entice our users
    to enter their personal information to measure the effectiveness of
    our security awareness training program? **Michael**: That's the
    worst idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom. **Samir**: Yes, this is
    horrible, this idea.
