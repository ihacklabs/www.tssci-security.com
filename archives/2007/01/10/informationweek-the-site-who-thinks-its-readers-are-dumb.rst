InformationWeek, the site who thinks its readers are dumb
#########################################################

Thank you very much InformationWeek! I was reading an IW article, `Adobe
Patches Acrobat And Reader XSS Bug, 3 Other
Flaws <http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196802752&cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All>`_,
hoping to get some useful information from it. The article contains **15
links**, two of which are other IW articles and three direct to Adobe's
website. The rest are "techweb" definitions for words like: PDF, bug,
computer, OS, Linux, server, patch, download. What the hell!?! I know
these might generate some advertising revenue, but seriously, defining
bug? computer?

After hovering over several of the links, I almost gave up. The two most
important links in the entire article, are easy to miss. They are:

-  `Adobe - Server-side workarounds to prevent potential cross-site
   scripting vulnerability in versions 7.0.8 and earlier of Adobe Reader
   and
   Acrobat <http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa07-02.html>`_
-  `Adobe - Update available for vulnerabilities in versions 7.0.8 and
   earlier of Adobe Reader and
   Acrobat <http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb07-01.html>`_

I have noticed this with every article InformationWeek puts out, and
it's incredibly annoying. I hope they read this. :mad:
