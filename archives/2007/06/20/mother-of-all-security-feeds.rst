Mother of all security feeds
############################

Using `Yahoo! Pipes <http://pipes.yahoo.com/>`_, I tied in over `100
different security blogs into a single
feed <http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=EAtqkC4f3BGX2mVIouNLYQ>`_,
sorted by newest on top, and encompasses all areas of security. When I
have some more time I'll add security news sites like DarkReading,
SecurityFocus, etc.

I know `Mark
Curphey <http://securitybuddha.com/2007/03/20/a-n-other-security-bloggers-network-alpha/>`_
was working on a a newer, improved SBN, but I don't know what happened
to it. If anyone has any tips for optimizing the pipe and filtering
irrelevant content out, let me know.
