SSN misuses
###########

These `two stories <http://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/misused.html>`_ are
interesting.. I wonder if Adam from `Emergent
Chaos <http://www.emergentchaos.com/>`_ has seen them:

    The most misused SSN of all time was (078-05-1120). In 1938, wallet
    manufacturer the E. H. Ferree company in Lockport, New York decided
    to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would
    fit into its wallets. A sample card, used for display purposes, was
    inserted in each wallet. **Company Vice President and Treasurer
    Douglas Patterson thought it would be a clever idea to use the
    actual SSN of his secretary, Mrs. Hilda Schrader Whitcher.**
