I've been real busy lately, but I came across several blogs and articles
this week that I'd like to share, `Andrew
Hay <http://www.andrewhay.ca/>`_ style. =)

`CEO Crime &
Punishment <http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/ceo-crime-punis.html>`_ --
Ben Horowitz, CEO of Opsware Inc., shares his thoughts on what entices
executives to commit white collar crime. Is it for money? Or is there
some other reason?

    *Warren Buffet once said that "marrying for the money probably isn't
    a good idea in any case, but if you are already rich, it makes no
    sense at all." The variation that applies to CEOs is "robbing
    investors probably isn't a good idea in any case, but if you are
    already rich, it makes no sense at all."*

`The Mainframe Conundrum <http://www.greebo.net/?p=424>`_ -- There are
many systems that power our economy, our infrastructure, and life on
Earth -- mainframes, that are powered by COBOL, IBM Assembly, and others
that also empower security mechanisms like RACF that researchers in the
security community seem to have skipped. I've thought about the state of
mainframe security and other critical systems, and it could be scary. I
know machines that cannot accept a password longer than 8 alphanumeric
characters, that power entire businesses. The amount of people who are
skilled in systems like VAX/VMS, TPF, z/OS is dwindling... Who will
review the critical applications that run on them?

    *Most large organizations have a 30-40 year investment in their
    applications and they're not going to re-write in a Johnny come
    lately language like Java or C# just because we can't review old
    code. There are literally billions of lines of COBOL out there, and
    it ... runs the world. There should and MUST be a way we can review
    this code.*

`Analyzing the Facebook Platform, three weeks
in <http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/analyzing_the_f.html>`_ -- Marc
Andreessen comments on the succesful launch of the Facebook API, that
allows developers to create applications that add functionality to
Facebook, but doesn't replace it. In it, he brings up the account of one
successful application that took off in a viral sense, originally being
hosted on two servers, now requires a couple hundred to keep up with the
load users have put on it. "Success kills" is one way of looking at it.
The developers of Facebook surely put a lot of time and effort into the
design of the system. We'll see soon enough how the API stands up
security-wise and the applications people write.

`Maryland Professor Creates Desktop Supercomputer
Prototype <http://www.ccnmag.com/news.php?id=5426>`_ -- Uzi Vishkin,
with the help of his students has created a prototype that utilizes 64
processors working in parallel, and is hundreds of times faster in some
cases than modern desktop computers. I look forward to the advancements
they make in this sector.

`Red Hat Linux gets Top Government Security
Rating <http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/18/1224243>`_ --
Another Slashdot posting, I know, but the comments are worth reading.
There's a lot that I forgot about or didn't know regarding the multitude
of ratings various agencies can award systems that meet specified
criteria. After reading the comments, I flipped through the `Orange
Book <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCSEC>`_ to refresh my memory. It's
old, but still good!

**Blog post to watch:**

`Joanna: We Can Detect Bluepill. Let Us Prove
It! <http://www.matasano.com/log/895/joanna-we-can-detect-bluepill-let-us-prove-it/>`_
and `We're ready for the Ptacek's
challenge! <http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2007/06/were-ready-for-ptaceks-challenge.html>`_
-- I'm a huge fan of the research both Joanna Rutkowska and the guys
over at Matasano have put out. Things will definitely get interesting as
Black Hat nears... exciting :D
