Got pwned today
###############

Several people in the corporate IT security group where I'm interning
this summer have been working hard on creating a program to educate
users on the company's acceptable use policies and some basic security
awareness. They've done a great job and the stuff they came up with
looks top notch. During lunch they're out talking to other employees,
answering their questions and even handing out nice Kingston
DataTraveler Secure Privacy edition usb thumb drives. (too bad they only
work on Windows, anyone get them running in Linux??)

Anyways, back to me getting owned... One of the other interns I work
with asked me to go print something off for her because she was busy
answering questions and things like that. At first I was a bit
hesistant, not knowing what exactly I was going to print. I was going
back to my desk anyways, but she told me I could print it from one of
the computers at the table not too far away. I assumed she didn't have a
printer set up there or something. Sure enough, I plug the usb drive she
gave me and up comes the "meltdown" program, which makes the screen look
all mushy. Had I taken it to my desk, I would have been safer because
Autorun was disabled, but still... that was embarrassing.

Yup... If you haven't noticed by now, women have no problems social
engineering men.
