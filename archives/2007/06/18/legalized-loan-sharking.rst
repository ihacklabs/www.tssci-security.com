Legalized loan sharking
#######################

I saw this on Slashdot last week, an article regarding "`Getting the
best deals from
Dell <http://consumerist.com/consumer/insiders/22-confessions-of-a-former-dell-sales-manager-268831.php>`_."
One bullet point really stuck out, about financing offers:

    9. **DPA/Dell Preferred** - This is the Dell credit card, like a
    Sears, Macy's or Radio Shack credit card. Typically a high rate, low
    limit card. The lowest APR is still around 18-20%, and that comes
    with a $5,000 limit. The $4,000, $3,000 and $2,000 limits have rates
    in the mid to high 20s. The lowest limt, $1,500, has an APR of
    29.99%. NEVER USE THIS UNLESS THERE IS A KILLER NO INTEREST
    PROMOTION.

This is nothing new, but it always gets to me -- credit cards, car
loans, banks, etc can charge you that much interest since the 1980. But
you know, if you or I were to loan some money to a friend or colleague
at an interest rate of more than 5-12% (dependent on state law), we
would be "loan sharking" because we're not a bank and they have separate
rules. What crap. How can anyone, bank or individual, get away with
charging 29.99% interest!?! Even better is point a, the exploitation of
freshmen college students. Bah, this should be a crime!
