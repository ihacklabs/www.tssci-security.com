Hacking Techniques for Law Enforcement - A good idea or asking for trouble?
###########################################################################

Mikko @ F-Secure made a
`post <http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-052007.html#00001201>`_
on their blog about whether or not law enforcement organizations should
be permitted to utilize security tools and hacking techniques in
investigations that got me thinking. To me the answer to this question
is very clear -- NO WAY JOSE! -- not unless proper oversight can be
implemented and safe guards to protect our privacy are devised.
`EFF <http://eff.org>`_, help us on this one!

Given that police have been abusing laws made to combat terrorism to
violate the rights of US citizens that are not members of terrorist
organizations, I think that opening the gates to allowing the use of
hacking techniques and malware invites a whole host of other problems.

The first problem that I have with this is the cost of training. Will
training police in computer security be cost-effective? I would be
leaning more towards saying no. Learning security techniques is not
something that they can create two week training courses on. Also, will
the cost of providing advanced security training to police provide
enough benefit to us to justify the spending?

The second problem that I have with this is the risk associated with
police using these tools and techniques without proper understanding of
the tools and their effects. Will Joe Blow Officer here in Phoenix know
what he's doing or will he be damaging my server I have at home while he
tries to install his spyware?

Another problem that I have with this is how will prosecutors be able to
prove that the data collected by investigators hasn't been tampered with
or fabricated. Without proper controls and oversight for these types of
operations officers with an axe to grind will be able to go penetrate
computers and plant fabricated evidence. Will companies be forced
through legislation to preinstall the software onto computers prior to
shipping them to consumers? and if so, will it be a felony to remove it?

Lastly, if we properly secure our systems against what I feel is a gross
violation of my rights to privacy, will there be legal ramifications?
Will I get sent to jail because I have a proper firewall and IDS? Will
they 'disarm' us of security tools like Britain did to their citizens
when taking firearms? Will security tools be outlawed without a license
to own them? We need to think about things like this and tell our local
government officials what we think before it's too late.
