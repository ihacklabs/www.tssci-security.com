Phrack a Day -- Revitalizing what has been lost
###############################################

I'd like to introduce a new segment we'll be doing called "Phrack a
Day." Casey and I are going back to the roots of the hacking and
phreaking culture and reading through every Phrack article, beginning
with the first one to the most current. We'll be outlining the main
points from each, provide some commentary, and show off a little history
that so many have forgotten.

Eric S. Raymond once said,

    "..being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more
    than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer."

There's more to hacking -- it's about freedom, solving problems, and
respect. With each blog post, we're going to live and embrace the spirit
of hacking, hoping we pass it on to others.

The other day, pdp at
`GNUCITIZEN <http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/hackers>`_ brought up the
movie *`Hackers <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/>`_* and the
e-zine, `Phreedom <http://www.phreedom.org>`_ as the reasons for getting
into hacking. The technical accuracy in Hackers may be incorrect, but
the culture is there, in plain sight. We'd like to join you pdp, in
revitalizing what has been lost. To anyone reading, if you have any
questions, comments, complaints, etc.. post 'em.
