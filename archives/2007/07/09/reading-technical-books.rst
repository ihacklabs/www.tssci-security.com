Reading technical books
#######################

Back in January, I asked Richard Bejtlich in an email to post some `tips
for reading
books <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/01/reading-tips.html>`_.
Reading technical books can be a drag at times, yet somehow he manages
to get through several a month. Reading is one of those tasks we all
have to do in our line of work, for obvious reasons. Well, I came across
`another blog
post <http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/06/reading-technical-books.html>`_
with another point for reading:

    All that I really needed from my first trip through the book was to
    know what was possible, not exactly how to do it.

My father always told me, if you don't understand something the first
time through, read it again until you do. Well sometimes, who needs to
know it on the first pass? I always forget why people have technical
books... for reference. It's not like a novel you read once and don't
pick up again because you already know how the story goes.

Maybe this is why I have started about 6-7 books this year and haven't
finished any?
