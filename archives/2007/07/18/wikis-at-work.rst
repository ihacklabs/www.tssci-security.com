title: Wikis at work

Wikis at work
#############

I love wikis. I've been working on a security portal at work and it just
got so much better with the addition of embedded RSS feeds. With this
`extension <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GISWiki/RSS>`_, I've
embedded the `Security
Whitelist <http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=4Oivw5Iq3BGiaXBOouNLYQ>`_
and `Aggregated Vendor and Security News
Sites <http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=3HK4PxQw3BG8CX5jYEsBXw>`_
pipes on the front page. This gives our team the ability to check the
latest news that is happening inside and outside of our company. I've
also added the `Web Application Security
Feed <http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=6DtXKisf3BG9zrnHyzUFzw>`_
in a seperate portal for our web app guys.

Within our policy pages, is an embedded rss feed that links to the
latest file uploads to the policy folder on the network. We also have a
page dedicated to vendor security and information bulletins.

If you don't have a wiki yet, start one. You can always worry about the
information organization later, and the sooner you start using wiki, the
easier things will be. Sharing information across your department will
be more enjoyable. I'm actually having fun with this... :)
