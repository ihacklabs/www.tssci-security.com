DEFCON 15
#########

DEFCON15 is this Friday and I'll be in Vegas Thursday night. I'll be
without Internet access this weekend, but I'll try and post something up
for Sunday. If anybody wants to meet up, send me an email. Gonna be a
good weekend. Some of the talks I'm interested in:

-  Dirty secrets of the security industry -- Bruce Potter
-  Tactical Exploitation - H.D. Moore and Valsmith
-  CiscoGate -- The Dark Tangent
-  The executable image exploit -- Michael Schrenk
-  The Market for Malware -- Thomas Holt
-  Malware Secrets -- Valsmith and Delchi
-  44 lines about 22 things that keep me up at night -- Agent X
-  The edge of forever - Making computer history -- Jason Scott
-  The Commercial Malware Industry -- Peter Gutmann

By the way, I put up a poll as I'm trying to get a consensus on what you
guys like. Do you prefer light text on a dark background, dark text on a
light background, or do you not care and just use RSS for reading posts?
