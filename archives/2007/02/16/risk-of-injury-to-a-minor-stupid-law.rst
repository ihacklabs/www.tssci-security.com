title: Risk of Injury to a Minor == Stupid Law

Risk of Injury to a Minor == Stupid Law
#######################################

I have been getting just as furious as
`paperghost <http://www.vitalsecurity.org/2007/02/and-i-will-strike-down-upon-thee-with.html>`_
lately over the whole `Julie Amero
case <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/14/julie_amero_case/>`_. By
now you've all heard about it, a substitute teacher was surfing the
internet and then bombarded with porn advertisements she couldn't get
away. People debate her initial reactors and the
woulda/coulda/shoulda's. I think she just paniced and didn't know what
to do, and when people panic, they don't always think straight or
rationally. She could have "pulled the plug," or "thrown her coat over
the monitor" or something stuipdly ridiculous like that... Or she was
just trying to close all the pop ups like so many of us are accostomed
too. Who the hell knows?

My point about this entire incident, is her actual criminal offense,
convicted on 4 counts of "risk of injury to a minor." What risk of
injury to a minor?! Are you kidding me? These were seventh graders, who
have been secretly browsing their father's Playboy's, Hustler tapes, and
going to sites like sex.com when their parents aren't around. How do I
know, you ask? I was once a seventh grader and I had many other friends
who did one of the three above. Let's not be hypocrites here now, don't
tell me you never were "curious" and clicked on 18+ when you weren't.
There were no injuries, and no risk of injuries, especially to a minor.
Give me a f-ing break!

Laws in America need to be revised, and if people haven't seen that yet
with this case, I am beginning to lose all hope.
