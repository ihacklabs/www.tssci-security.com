Infosec pros aren't afraid to cry wolf
######################################

Look left when everyone looks right and say no when everyone says yes.
Then, ask why? You're in the position as a security professional to tell
the bosses no; that's what you're paid for. Don't be afraid to cry wolf
when something is out of the ordinary, and do it often. It may not be
*it*\ this time, but sooner or later, it will be for real and will then
look better on you than the incident that slipped by and you not calling
it out.

I just wanted to share these thoughts in addition to a little
`story <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/02/a_tale_of_two_security_viewpoints.html>`_
from a mailing list LonerVamp posted.
