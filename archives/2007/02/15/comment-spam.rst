Comment Spam
############

Spam sucks. Why do spammers have to ruin every communication medium out
there? Postal mail, email, popups, malware/spyware, and now comment
spam. LonerVamp over at `terminal23 <http://www.terminal23.net/>`_ has
noticed an increase in spam on his blog as well. I had used Akismet to
help combat spam, but my host is currently not allowing outbound
requests on port 80, so my site cannot contact the Akismet server. Thus,
until I figure out with them how to mitigate this, I am going to have to
moderate all comments before they are posted.
