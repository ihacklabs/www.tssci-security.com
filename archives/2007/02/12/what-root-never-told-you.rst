title: What root never told you

What root never told you
########################

While in L.A. at SCALE, I attended "Admin++, What root Never Told You,"
by Ron Gorodetzky, sysadmin for Digg.com and Revision3. His presentation
gave some insight and tidbits on the things you forget when you have
your own startup, and the other problems you enounter. Things like
scaling, availability, power, managed server, co-location, datacenter
etc.. He made a point to monitor your monitoring station -- because you
don't get pages, doesn't mean everything is just dandy. Ron also pointed
everyone to the document on upgrading `LiveJournal's
backend, <http://danga.com/words/2005_oscon/oscon-2005.pdf>`_ to get a
picture of what it's like to design a scalable architecture. I read this
document a while back when I was first learning computer networking and
security, and it blew my mind away. I never fathomed the amount of work
that goes into these sites. I wonder how `Building Scalable Web
Sites <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/web2apps/>`_ is when it comes to
desiging large web sites.
