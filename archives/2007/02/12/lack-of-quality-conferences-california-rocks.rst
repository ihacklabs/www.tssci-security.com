title: (lack of) quality conferences -- California rocks

(lack of) quality conferences -- California rocks
#################################################

Why are so many conferences filled with so much marketing dribble? I
planned on going to a lot more talks while at SCALE but only attended
one in its entirety. Some presenters started off their presentation
stating they would "market" their product for the first five minutes,
but then continued throughout the rest of their presentation going into
all the features it delivers. Are conference organizers really this
desperate during the CFP they allow companies to market their products?

I thought vendor expos were for this (they did have one), and the
conferences talks were more vendor-neutral. The presentations I sat in
for about 15 minutes were basically product demos. I'm dissapointed in
the quality of talks at SCALE. Fortunately we were in L.A. and took the
afternoons to go out to Hollywood and Santa Monica to have some fun. I
definitely want to go back soon and have a trip. It's a nice change from
Arizona and the East coast, cool atmosphere and culture, especially for
me who's in their 20's... :)
