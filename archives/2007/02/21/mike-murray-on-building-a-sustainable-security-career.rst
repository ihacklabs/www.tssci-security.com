Mike Murray on building a sustainable security career
#####################################################

Hey Mike, thanks for posting your
`presentation <http://www.episteme.ca/index.php?/archives/252-Slides-Building-a-Sustainable-Security-Career.html>`_
(Building a Sustainable Security Career) you gave to ISSA-NH the other
day. I found it interesting, since "your father's 6 fundamental
assumptions about work" were the same I had for quite a while. You can
definitely see how the talk can apply outside of information security,
so I'm re-posting it here for my friends and others who would otherwise
miss it.
