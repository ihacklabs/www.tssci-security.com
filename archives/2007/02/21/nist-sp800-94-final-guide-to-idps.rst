NIST SP800-94 -- Final Guide to (IDPS)
######################################

**`SP 800-94 <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/#sp800-94>`_,
*Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)***, seeks to
assist organizations in understanding intrusion detection system and
intrusion prevention system technologies and in designing, implementing,
configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining intrusion detection
and prevention system (IDPS) solutions. It provides practical,
real-world guidance for each of four classes of IDPS products:
network-based, wireless, network behavior analysis software, and
host-based. The publication also provides an overview of complementary
technologies that can detect intrusions, such as security information
and event management software. It focuses on enterprise IDPS solutions,
but most of the information in the publication is also applicable to
standalone and small-scale IDPS deployments. This publication replaces
NIST SP 800-31, Intrusion Detection Systems.
