Hosting dropped out, update your links
######################################

Hey everyone. Earlier today my hosting had expired and I had to migrate
to new host. Update your bookmarks to account for the changes. The new
URL address of my blog is
`www.tssci-security.com <www.tssci-security.com>`_.

Thankfully, most of you who subscribe via RSS shouldn't have to make
any changes due to my feeds being handled by FeedBurner at
`http://feeds.feedburner.com/tssci <http://>`_.
