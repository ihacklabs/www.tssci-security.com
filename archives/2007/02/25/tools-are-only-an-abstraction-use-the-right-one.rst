title: Tools are only an abstraction, use the right one

Tools are only an abstraction, use the right one

Do `tools make us
dumber <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/02/are_tools_making_us_dumber.html>`_?
I don't agree with the idea exactly, as they are just that, tools. Tools
are just another level of abstraction from thinking at a lower level.
It's what distinguishes an engineer from a kit builder. Who here wants
to program in 1's and 0's, or use Maxwell's equation in designing
integrated circuits? There may be times where an engineer working in
their field will need to know, but many of us operate at higher levels
and thus, are abstracted from it all.

Using tools effectively though, requires a knowledge of the key
underlying workings and also calls for the right tool for the right job.
Often times, we try and use a Leatherman to build a house when it comes
to security. You have your NAC this and UNP that and all these other
"all in one appliances," and still don't have everything you need to do
the job properly. I feel the Unix philosophy is spot on here; you have a
tool that does one thing, and one thing well. You tie multiple tools
together to accomplish more involved tasks.
