SCALE this weekend
##################

I'm heading out to Los Angelos for the `5th Annual Southern California
Linux Expo <http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale5x/>`_. I'll try and post
inbetween sessions (that is... whenever I can). I'll be attending these
talks:

-  **Leveraging the IT Community** (This talk is focused on a building a
   new broad resource for sysadmins by sysadmins. Starting with the
   concepts that made the site Wikipedia a great success and tools like
   grep so universal, this talk will discuss the challenges of building
   a large IT community / knowledge base and how to bring IT
   troubleshooting to the next level.)
-  **Admin++, what root never told you** (In this talk will go over some
   of the lessons he learned from helping to simultaneously build two
   startups facing different technological challenges: "Digg" and
   "Revision3")
-  **How to monitor your infrastructure with Open Source software**
   (Systems Management is one of the most expensive and time consuming
   parts of an IT guy's job. Open source software is making it easier to
   deploy and integrate systems management as well as making it cheaper
   to manage your infrastructure. Erik Dahl, the leader of the open
   source Zenoss project will share his experience developing monitoring
   solutions...)
-  **Web Applications: What is your backup/recovery plan?** (One of the
   overlooked mission critical task is the backup and recovery of the
   critical data maintained by these applications. This session will
   examine backup and recovery requirements for Web applications,
   various open source tools that can be used to achieve them and best
   practices.)
-  **New & Improved: How a More Modern IT Security Model Can Better
   Protect Enterprise Data on Linux Systems** (...discuss the inherent
   limitations of existing enterprise security approaches and will
   outline the key elements of an end-to-end IT infrastructure,
   highlighting the tremendous security benefits this approach offers
   enterprises of all types using Linux systems.)

I'll post pictures as well from the weekend...
