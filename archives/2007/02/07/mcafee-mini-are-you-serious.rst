McAfee Mini -- are you serious??
################################

McAfee now has thier own wicked custom `Mini
Cooper <http://www.avertlabs.com/research/blog/?p=197>`_! Wow! Special,
huh? Black with an ugly white/red sticker on the hood and doors. It
looks wild and fast just sitting still like that!

Come on McAfee, you can do better than that. Where's the paint job? or
at least a custom license plate? Hahaha.
