title: Watch out for this hacker

Watch out for this hacker
#########################

Alright, so... I logged into Facebook (yes I know.. and probably easy to
find as well, whatever), checked my messages and noticed I received an
invitation to a group called "`watch out for this
hacker <http://uat.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5132263674>`_." From the
description:

    If somebody called bm\_tnoo7@hotmail.com adds you to their facebook
    account DONT accept it because its a hacker. Tell everyone on your
    list because if somebody on your list adds them you get them on your
    list he'll figure out your ID computer address. So copy and paste
    this message to everyone even if you hate them and fast because if
    he hacks their mail he hacks yours

The group has almost 2000 members, and I just gotta say... this is
hilarious. WTF is a "ID computer address?" o\_O

So a bunch of people, some smarter than others, start talking about how
this is possible/not possible/etc. The group starter, responds to the
flurry of comments with this:

    LET ME STOP ALL THIS COMMOTION....I CREATED THIS GROUP IN HOPES THAT
    I CAN PREVENT YOU GUYS FROM BEING HACKED...I KNOW WAT IM TALKING
    ABOUT, AND IT IS NOT THRU YOUR IP ADDRESS THAT HE'LL GET INTO THE
    SYSTEM...HE USES DIFFERENT METHODS. ALL THESE NERDS TALKIN ABOUT
    THEY ARE AN EXPERTISE, DONT NO SHIT...NOT EVEN CLOSE...IF ONLY U
    KNEW....ILL STOP RITE THERE

Yup.. okay buddy. Best comment I read so far:

    "ID computer address"... wow. Someone get Ted Stevens on the line.
