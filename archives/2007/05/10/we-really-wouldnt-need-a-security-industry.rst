title: We really wouldn't need a security industry

We really wouldn't need a security industry
###########################################

if everybody was honest with themselves and others. If people didn't
break into other people's houses, bank accounts, commit acts that are
criminal and deprive (or take advantage of) others' rights, we wouldn't
need security. Remember the days you could leave your front door
unlocked? Whatever happened to taking people for their word? Nowadays,
you need contracts and a bunch of legal hoopla to communicate with one
another.

Recall "risk" -- threat x vulnerability x asset value. Take the threat
out of the equation and you no longer have a risk -- nobody would care
to take advantage of it. Take the vulnerability out of the equation
(like Bruce Schneier did) and you have a completely secure system.
What's the most practical way to lower risk? Eliminate the threat or
remove the vulnerabilities? We can't do both 100%, so what Schneier is
suggesting, is unreasonable and impossible. The best we can do is work
with law enforcement and justice system to remove the threat as best we
can and through improved processes, create systems with less
vulnerabilities.

    " ....as long as people are involved, security threats can never be
    completely eliminated" - Viktor Cherkashin, KGB officer
