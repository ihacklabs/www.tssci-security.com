Protecting data in use
######################

Last week, I
`blogged <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/05/17/vulnerabilities-of-low-probability-bring-about-devestating-impact/>`_
about data classification and how it's difficult for many organizations
to gain control of. The next day SearchSecurity published `Data
classification is first step in successful data
protection <http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid14_gci1252535,00.html?track=sy260>`_,
an article that addresses the need to classify data to properly secure
it. The trouble with it is the enormous amounts of data we create and
getting a grip of it all. I see companies begin new "data classification
initiatives" and most have ended up failing within a couples years,
followed by a new "improved" initiative. We've also shifted from
protecting the devices that hold our data to protecting the data itself.
Classifying data helps in every respect towards our goal of information
security.

The other day, LonerVamp asks `how are you protecting your data in
use <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/05/data_protection_rambling_data.html>`_?
In some business units, protecting data through digital rights
management is a viable solution for enforcing restrictions; such as the
number of times a document is viewed, when it expires, whether it can be
printed, etc. It doesn't prevent someone from taking a screenshot or
reciting its information, but what else is there to do (technically
speaking)?
