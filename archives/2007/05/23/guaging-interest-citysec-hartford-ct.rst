Guaging interest, CitySec -- Hartford, CT
#########################################

Is anyone in the Hartford, Connecticut area between Boston and Manhattan
interested in a CitySec meetup? I'm gauging interest for those located
between the two cities (like myself). Anybody care to share a trip
report for BeanSec or NYSec meetings?
