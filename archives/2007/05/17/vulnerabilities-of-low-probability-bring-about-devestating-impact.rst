title: Vulnerabilities of low probability bring about devestating impact

Vulnerabilities of low probability bring about devestating impact

(Continued from `Consumerization of IT and state of the security
industry <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/05/17/consumerization-of-it-and-state-of-the-security-industry/>`_
and a reply to `Low probability but a devestating
impact <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/05/15/low-probability-but-a-devestating-impact/>`_.)

After lunch, we broke up into several groups and I headed to the
discussion on "next generation threat analysis," which worked to
identify vulnerabilities with a low probability of being exploited, but
have a huge impact on business. Some of the vulnerabilities were very
sensitive, so I'll be vague here -- sorry guys.

Corporate espionage and planting evidence was at the top of our lists,
followed by sensitive unencrypted network traffic, SCADA, legacy
applications and weak database security. Also included was sensitive
information being stored in clear text, ssh port forwarding and
encrypted outbound channels. These are definitely not unique to one
company -- I'm sure many companies worry about these exact
vulnerabilities as well.

I've seen data classification, knowing what you have and where it is
come up in many discussions with folks at conferences and other
meetings. Definitely tough with so much data, you have to ask where to
start -- usually you have no choice but to start classifying new data.
Classifying existing petabytes of information is close to impossible!
