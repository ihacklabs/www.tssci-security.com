title: Consumerization of IT and state of the security industry

Consumerization of IT and state of the security industry
########################################################

Yesterday was a bit of a surprise for me, I met someone I never would
have expected to meet and be an actual co-worker too. There were several
talks today, focusing on the "consumerization" of IT, the state of the
security industry from a Wall Street analysts' perspective, what makes
up an effective infosec program, and how to sell security to management.

Consumer trends in IT industry is scary from a security standpoint. Our
customers will increasingly expect to use third-party (unsupported)
systems and applications and it is important we draw the line now. For
example, work email and webmail, Skype and other WebEx type software.
Our customers ask why they should pay for email access when they have
Gmail or spends thousands per month on conference numbers. We are seeing
a shift towards letting users have external IM and we need to decide
[quickly] how we are going to prevent intellectual property data leakage
through monitoring, encryption, etc.

On Wall Street, we see Symantec and McAfee losing ground to Microsoft
and Cisco, who own much of the security space today. Companies are being
bought up left and right while customers are shifting away from one
company and towards another. It was interesting to hear opinions on some
of the recent acquisitions and IPOs that went public. You know there
have only been two security IPOs in the past five years?
`GUID <http://finance.google.com/finance?q=GUID>`_ and
`FIRE <http://finance.google.com/finance?q=FIRE>`_

The talk on what makes an effective infosec program had good data, but
the information was conveyed poorly and made the presentation very dry.
My eyes began to glaze over trying to take in the information (big
words), and I soon started to daydream.

In my next blog post, I'll discuss what we thought were vulnerabilities
with a low probability of being exploited, but would severely impact the
business if successfully exploited.
