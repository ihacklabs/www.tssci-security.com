Dell + Google Toolbar... profit??!?!

    - Those bastards, how is this business practice not illegal?

    *New Dell machines that include the Google toolbar as part of a
    marketing agreement also include a secret program that redirects
    non-url information typed into a browser window to a Dell-branded
    page filled with ads. For example if you type in dogfood.cim,
    instead of getting a browser error message, the secret Google
    Address Redirector redirects the query to an ad-filled page of
    search results.*

They're simply redirecting invalid DNS requests to their own page. When
you use OpenDNS, they redirect mistyped queries to their own page as
well. OpenDNS is having a fit because it's competing with their `revenue
stream <http://www.opendns.com/faq/#how_does_opendns_make_money>`_,
`powered by Yahoo! <http://guide.opendns.com/?url=tssci-security.org>`_

To remove all installed software, leaving you with a clean system and
for those who don't wish to reformat their new computer, run `PC
Decrapifier <http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/>`_.
