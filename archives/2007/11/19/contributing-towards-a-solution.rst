Roger Halbheer, Chief Security Advisor for Microsoft Europe, Middle
East, and Africa posted a comment last week in response to my post on
"`Operating Systems are only as secure as the idiot using
it <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/11/01/operating-systems-arent-any-more-secure-than-the-idiot-using-it/>`_."
Roger is looking for some open discussion on improving the security
usability problem, instead of sitting back and complaining about it.

I have `posted a
response <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/11/01/operating-systems-arent-any-more-secure-than-the-idiot-using-it/#comment-2470>`_
to his comment and Dre has also put some thought into his reply as well.
Some highlights:

    Security engineering is not easy, and history has proven time and
    time again that humans are infallible. We need to design secure
    systems from the ground up, taking account for every distant node of
    every network, both logical and physical. Take a banking application
    for example; not only does the site have to be secure and free of
    flaws, but also out-of-band channels used for transport
    communications, such as account creation, recovery, etc.

From Dre;

    While reading, "Geekonomics: The Real Cost of Insecure Software"
    and speaking with people at Fortify Software, Veracode, Cigital, and
    MITRE... I'm sold on the concept of a five-star "software
    security assurance" rating system for both commercial and
    open-source software to solve the "stem" of this user+security
    problem...

    ...get the five-star rating system published everywhere, on the
    software boxes, in newspapers, magazines, and everywhere the product
    name goes. Make it a part of consumer reports; make it the most
    important part of consumer reports. Make sure that expiration dates
    are also published with the ratings, and have a place online where
    people can go to check all the latest information on their software
    security assurance ratings for all the applications that they use.

This doesn't even begin to touch the surface in Dre's post. Definitely
check it out, it's a worthy read.
