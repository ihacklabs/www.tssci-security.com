More on Google Analytics: Now with Stolen Search Queries!
#########################################################

In my earlier article on `Using Google Analytics to Subvert
Privacy <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/09/12/using-google-analytics-to-subvert-privacy/>`_,
I demonstrated how dangerous free tools could be to match privacy
information to web clicks.

But now that Google has `updated their Analytics
service <http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9042838>`_
to support internal search queries, you can now link user privacy
information to search data, as well. Now everyone can be as famous as
AOL, get `reported to the
FTC <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/16/aol_suffers_ftc_complaint/>`_,
and get your own `stalk your users <http://www.aolstalker.com>`_
website. Although, unlike AOL, you can't fire 2,000 people in one day.

A month ago, I helped run a conference called
`Lulzcon <http://www.lulzcon.com>`_ in downtown Chicago. I met `Virgil
Griffith <http://virgil.gr>`_ there, who spoke about a famous
application he wrote called
`WikiScanner <http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr>`_. We discussed some of the
privacy issues around these sorts of tools, and I think this applies
back to the original arguments about Google Analytics.

Marcin wrote back in mid-August about `safer
browsing <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/08/15/8-firefox-extensions-towards-safer-browsing/>`_,
but that's only the beginning. RIA/RCP's are about to explode, and you
can bet that Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, eBay - and all the major players
will be utilizing this technology. As we've seen with
`Java <http://www.metasploit.com/research/misc/decloak/>`_ and
`Flash <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/08/scanning-with-flash.html>`_
applets - access to the local network stack can be devastating to both
your privacy and intranet/home security when accessing the Internet.
This isn't meant to scare you, it's meant to warn you how to think
differently and react to what will likely be the new attack paths of
2008. I also hope that the "big browsers" will start to react to these
growing problems.

You've probably heard a lot of push-back from Google about privacy
issues. They aren't really doing a lot about it other than keeping their
applications up to high quality and security standards. They have played
down click fraud. They have played down blackhat SEO, while gaming
PageRank seems to be still very popular. I even ran across a very
interesting website called `Google
Rankings <http://googlerankings.com>`_.

If you want to learn more about Google Analytics, I highly recommend
`this
article <http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2007/08/21/google-analytics-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know/>`_,
and their blog/website, LunaMetrics (including a new article on
`Analytics for Site
Search <http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2007/10/16/the-new-google-analytics-part-i-analytics-for-site-search/>`_).
There is also more information at `EpikOne <http://www.epikone.com>`_
and `TheMilk <http://www.themilk.net>`_, and you can read more about
general information on analytics by joining the `Web Analytics Yahoo
Group <http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/webanalytics/>`_.
