ToorCon 9 - Day 0 and 1
#######################

This weekend I was in San Diego, California for ToorCon 9 and had an
absolute blast. On Friday, I had checked out the USS Midway Aircraft
Carrier Museum and enjoyed listening to veterans recount fascinating
experiences on the ship during the war. I took the morning to
"experience" the city, something I have tried doing while attending
conferences. It sucks to travel to various cities around the country and
not getting the chance to visit local landmarks and famous sites.

While I was out and about around the city, Dre was doing his seminar
talk on `Continuous Prevention
Testing <http://toorcon.org/2007/event.php?id=27>`_. Stay tuned for an
upcoming blog post from Dre soon that goes over the main points of his
talk. I was lucky enough to catch Charlie Miller's seminar talk on `Real
World Fuzzing <http://toorcon.org/2007/event.php?id=60>`_. It was a
great presentation, and since fuzzing is still new to me, I was able to
see the why, what and how aspects of it. There was a lot of talk about
code coverage with fuzzing and is interesting given the recent web
application scanner code coverage `review done by Larry
Suto <http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20071014/web-application-scanning-depth-statistics/>`_
which reported NTOSpider as being best because it can crawl more links
in default mode. Dre will have also have some more commentary about
Charlie's talk and Larry Suto's review as well.

On Saturday, I went to Jason Medeiros' talk, "`The Last Stand: 100%
Automatic 0day, Achieved, Explained, and
Demonstrated <http://toorcon.org/2007/event.php?id=19>`_." Jason wrote a
tool that is a debugger, heap analyzer, fuzzer all in one that
automagically generates a C exploit. It was pretty awesome; I think he
wrote over 80,000 lines of code and spent an entire year doing it. A
couple people are skeptical about his demo though, stating it could have
been taylored with his demo application.

Afterwards, several of us went out to eat for seafood and sushi. I tried
sushi for the first time and well.. now I know I definitely do not like
it. LOL. Thanks Erich for letting me try some. Following dinner, we went
to the Microsoft sponsored party at Ol√© Madrid down on Gaslamp, which
was pretty good. Pretty much everyone in security was there, and then
again at the ninja party.

That's it for Friday and Saturday... next blog post from me will cover
Sunday's talks.

**Update 10/26:** `Toorcon 9 - Day 2 has been
