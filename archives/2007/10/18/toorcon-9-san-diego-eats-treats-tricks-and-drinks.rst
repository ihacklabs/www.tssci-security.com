ToorCon 9: San Diego -- Eats, Treats, Tricks and Drinks
#######################################################

Several of us are going to `ToorCon
9 <http://toorcon.org/2007/conference.php>`_ this weekend in San Diego,
California. I'm flying out tomorrow (Friday) morning and I plan on
visiting some sites around town, such as The `Aircraft Carrier/USS
Midway Museum <http://www.midway.org>`_ and then head up to Little Italy
in the Gaslamp section for some lunch. Following, I plan to hit up the
`Extraordinary Desserts <http://www.extraordinarydesserts.com>`_ to
satisfy my craving after being on a diet for over six weeks. 12 lbs,
beat that :P

Dre will be speaking at ToorCon on Friday during the seminars session,
titled "`Continuous Prevention
Testing <http://toorcon.org/2007/event.php?id=27>`_." His presentation
was well received and met with positive feedback at this week's
Minneapolis OWASP meeting. Be sure to check it out if you're attending
seminars on Friday. From the description:

    Continuous testing presents methodologies and tools that developers,
    quality engineers, and security professionals can all share and use
    effectively to their own unique approach. The tools presented are
    cross-discipline, meaning they can be utilized by a developer as a
    development tool, by a qa-tester as a quality assurance tool, and by
    a vulnerability assessor as a security assurance tool. Whether
    you're trying to build better code faster, demonstrate the power of
    automated testing using a data-driven test framework, or find
    security-related defects - Continuous testing has something for you.

San Diego and ToorCon is sounding like it's going to be a lot of fun. If
you're in the area or attending the conference and you want to meet up,
shoot me an email or comment reply on this post with your email address.
We'll be going out after the conference to eat and drink so be ready. :)
