Spread the OWASP Holiday Cheer
##############################

Linux.com is running a feature article on `Building Secure Web
Applications with OWASP <http://www.linux.com/feature/123070>`_. We're
trying to Slashdot it, so everybody who reads this -- go and do that
right now!

The article is good and features quotes from Josh Sweeney of
`SecurityDistro.com <http://www.securitydistro.com/>`_. I met Josh at
the `VERIFY 2007 Conference <http://verifyconference.com/>`_ in
Washington DC about two months ago -- and really enjoyed the nice words
he had to say about OWASP in this new article.

One of the most interesting parts of this article is that it mentions
the OWASP Sponsorship programs. For those that don't know, I was working
with Mark Curphey on the `OWASP Web Security Certification
Framework <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SpoC_007_-_The_OWASP_Web_Security_Certification_Framework>`_.
This project was a part of the `OWASP Spring of Code
2007 <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007>`_
sponsorship program.

Mark wrote the first 50 or so pages until I was brought in to
collaborate. Our October release was made available in book format on
`Lulu.com <http://stores.lulu.com/owasp>`_. The book is entitled, `OWASP
Evaluation And Certification
Criteria <http://www.lulu.com/content/1412144>`_. It's available in PDF
as a free download, as well as in paperback book form at a small cost.

I'm going to release an updated version of that document within the next
two weeks. I would appreciate it if those of you out there who have
interest in this (or PABP / PA-DSS) would join the `owasp-webcert
mailing-list <https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-webcert/>`_. You
may also post a comment here and I will contact you to get involved.
This is an open document with an open project, so it deserves lots of
peer review!

In order to not taint myself, I have also avoided reading the PABP
best-practices and the PA-DSS draft requirements/standard. However, I am
going to read PA-DSS `once it is
completed <http://pcianswers.com/2007/11/14/pci-ssc-adds-pa-dss-to-faq/>`_,
which should also be very soon.
