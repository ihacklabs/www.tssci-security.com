Incompetent blurring
####################

While chatting in #snort-gui today, somebody noticed Gizmodo was
`showing off their
ticket <http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/announcements/apple-nab-buzz-building-giz-has-tickets-in-hand-245632.php>`_
to Apple NAB. You can see they blurred the Name, Company and barcode on
the ticket. Whoever did this, did a poor job because they didn't blur
the name on the right-hand side.. What was the point of blurring it? Not
to mention, some reported seeing the barcode show up crystal clear in
their rss reader. Quick check on the image location and it linked to
http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2007/03/nab\_appleevent2.jpg.

Like anyone would, I deleted the '2' from the image file name and
checked out what the image was. Sure enough, the image showed up with
the barcode in the clear.

They fixed the problem, but not before a couple of us snagged a
`copy <http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nab_appleevent.jpg>`_.
