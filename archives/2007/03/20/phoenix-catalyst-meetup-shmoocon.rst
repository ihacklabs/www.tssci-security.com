Phoenix catalyst meetup, ShmooCon
#################################

Tonight I had a great time hanging out with Michael Santarcangelo of
`Security Catalyst <http://www.securitycatalyst.com/>`_, `Andre
Gironda <http://blogs.owasp.org/dre>`_, `Erich
Newell <http://www.erichnewell.com/>`_ and `Adam
Muntner <http://www.azspf.org/>`_. There were a bunch of other guys (and
Grace!) there, but I apologize for not remembering your names. It was
fun talking though! Gotta watch out for that one dude's company who has
had a bunch of weird deaths like cancer and dead people lying in their
house for a week at a time... LOL

Anyways, I'm getting ready to go to ShmooCon/Labs out in Washington D.C.
this week(end). I look forward to meeting `Richard
Bejtlich <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/>`_ and attending the
`NoVaSec <http://novasec.blogspot.com/>`_ meeting, Landon from `Digital
Bond <http://www.digitalbond.com/>`_ and `Martin
McKeay <http://www.mckeay.net/>`_. If you wanna meet up - post a comment
here/send me an email/or call my cell phone. Also,try and make it to the
ShmooCon meetup in
`Room362 <http://www.room362.com/pages/shmoocon07.html>`_. I will also
be playing tourist with my buddy Daniel, the security admin at our
school, UAT. We'll try and check out the `International Spy
Museum <http://www.spymuseum.org/>`_ and also the `Smithsonian National
Air & Space Museum <http://www.nasm.si.edu/>`_.

I cannot wait, this conference is going to be awesome. See you guys
there.
