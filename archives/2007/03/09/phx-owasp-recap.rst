phx-owasp recap
###############

Last night I attended my first Phoenix-OWASP meeting hosted at UAT.
There were around 30 people in attendance from all backgrounds,
including independent researchers, government agencies, private sector,
and academia. `Andre Gironda <http://blogs.owasp.org/dre>`_ had a cool
presentation (available in PDF) `Reflections on Trusting the Same-Origin
Policy <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix#Previous_Meetings>`_.
Adam Muntner, also in attendance is now a Trusted Catalyst/contributor
to `The Security Catalyst <http://www.securitycatalyst.com/>`_ and
starts off with a bang with `5 Questions to Ask Your Web Application
Vendor <http://www.securitycatalyst.com/2007/03/09/five-questions-to-ask-your-web-application-vendor/>`_

I enjoyed last nights meeting, getting to know a couple people, and look
forward to meeting them again at `ShmooCon <http://www.shmoocon.org>`_
and at the `March 26 Arizona Security Practioner's
Forum <http://www.azspf.org/node/125>`_.
