ShmooCon 2007 - Lab Day 1
#########################

We got our NOC up and running. Critical services have been set up for
the most part, and we'll be doing some tuning today. Not new to us all,
things don't always work the way you want, so that's what we're
currently going through today. To anyone here at the con, don't login to
any services over clear text, and try and use pub certs wherever
possible. If in doubt, just remember that we are at a security con, and
we're doing full packet dumps.. just a friendly reminder.

I'll be hitting up the NoVaSec meeting with Landon from Digital Bond and
also the pod/vid casters meetup at
`room362 <http://www.room362.com/pages/shmoocon07.html>`_. So, if you're
in town, feel free to meet us there. I've been having a great time at
ShmooCon so far, and everyone I met has been really cool.
