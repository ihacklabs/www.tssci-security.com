Dell and Linux - Survey
#######################

Thanks to the amount of feedback on Ideastorm, Dell is seriously
considering pre-installing Linux on desktop systems. Having had the
chance to play with the Core 2 Duo systems Dell puts out, I can
definitely say they are pimpin'. I want one, but my main concern is
Linux hardware compatibility. I would like a stable desktop that runs
Linux for a primary workstation, and these Dell's are my top choice.

Go to `Dell.com/linuxsurvey <http://www.dell.com/linuxsurvey>`_ and fill
out the short survey to give them a better idea in what you're looking
for in a Linux Desktop. If anything, giving average customers the option
of choosing between "Windows Vista ($100)" or "Ubuntu Linux (free)"
would greatly help spread mainstream Linux adoption.
