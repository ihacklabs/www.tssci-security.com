title: Weaponizing Noam Chomsky

Weaponizing Noam Chomsky
########################

I wanted to ask Dan Kaminsky, who btw is a brilliant presenter (more
below), about doing grammar and writing style analysis to determine who
wrote a paper. I can see the techniques as potentially having forensic
uses. Don't ask me what his talk was about, I would not be able to
recall any useful details. Here is what his talk description stated:

    **Weaponizing Noam Chomsky, or Hacking with Pattern Languages**
    There is no man page for the English language, but kids pick it up
    anyway (more or less). There is deep structure hidden inside every
    human generated language, especially those we intend to fuzz. I will
    discuss and demonstrate new, useful, and purty purty tools for
    rendering complex patterns automatically, potentially in realtime,
    and breaking things with it. New toys will be released, including a
    generic XML fuzzer (rawk!).

This was my first time seeing Dan talk and it was very entertaining and
surprising to watch him react and respond to questions from the
audience. No matter how annoying or frequently the questions came, he
was quick on his feet(even after drinking four beers) to counter-attack.
