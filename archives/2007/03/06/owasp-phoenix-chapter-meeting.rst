OWASP-Phoenix Chapter Meeting
#############################

From the `Owasp-phoenix mailing
list <http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-phoenix>`_:

This month we have an exciting technical talk discussing the Same-Origin
Policy and attacks that attempt to break/circumvent these controls by
security researcher Andre Gironda. The details of this month's meeting
are below:

**Where:**

    UAT - University of Advancing Technology (Entrance at the back of the
    building)
    2625 West Baseline Road
    Tempe, Arizona 85283-1056

**When:**

    6:30PM, Thursday, March 8th

**Agenda:**

    6:30 to 6:45 News & Introductions
    6:45 to 7:45 (1 hour): Reflections on Trusting the Same-Origin Policy
    – and other web+network trust issues – Andre Gironda, Independent
    Vulnerability Assessor / Researcher

In computing, the same origin policy is an important security measure
for client-side scripting (mostly Javascript). It prevents a document or
script loaded from one "origin" from getting or setting properties of a
document from a different "origin". It was designed to protect browsers
from executing code from external websites, which could be malicious.

XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities exploit trust shared between a user and a
website by circumventing the same-domain policy. DNS Pinning didn't pan
out exactly right, either. Can client-side scripting allow malicious
code to get into your browser history and cache? Can it enumerate what
plugins you have installed in your browser, or even programs you have
installed to your computer? Can it access and modify files on your local
hard drive or other connected filesystems? Can client-side scripts be
used to access and control everything you access online? Can it be used
to scan and attack your Intranet / local network? Does an attacker have
to target you in order to pull off one of these attacks successfully? If
I turn off Javascript or use NoScript, am I safe? What other trust
relationships does the web application n-Tier model break?

    7:45 to 8:00: Wrap up

    8:00 Happy Hour/Social:
