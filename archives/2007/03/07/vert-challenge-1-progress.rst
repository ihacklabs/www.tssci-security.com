VERT Challenge #1 Progress
##########################

The folks at nCircle Blog have posted a `VERT
Challenge <http://blog.ncircle.com/blogs/vert/archives/2007/03/vert_challenge_1.html>`_,
and hopefully more to come. You can check out the details at their blog,
but I'll be posting my progress here and we'll see how far I can get
before I either a.) give up, or b.) someone else gets it, or c.)
hopefully win!

Anyways the requirements are as so:

-  Locate the WinNY application Online (Both Versions 1 and 2)
-  Determine how to perform proper WinNY detection. (remotely -- via the
   listening TCP port)

What you need to provide in order to win:

-  Any encryption, authentication or hashing used for communication.
-  A breakdown of the information provided by WinNY when you connect to
   it.
-  The unencrypted strings that distinquish between WinNY 1 and WinNY 2.
-  Bonus Points for providing a script or source code to perform the
   detection.

I have located both versions 1 and 2 of the the p2p software... I'll
begin working on identifying them on the network soon. Stay tuned for
further progress and good luck to anyone else participating.
