Thinking of Exporting Classified Material? Think Again
######################################################

`ITT was fined $100
million <http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/27/news/international/itt_export/index.htm?postversion=2007032713>`_
for illegally exporting classified technical data relating to night
vision equipment overseas. In addition to being fined, they must "invest
$50 million over five years to accelerate development of night vision
technology, and the government will maintain rights to all technology
that is developed under the agreement."

This incident should raise awareness to all companies who manufacture or
develop export controlled commodities. In security, we need to ensure we
comply with all EAR/ITAR/AECA regulations and prevent unauthorized
exports to foreign nationals.

   the U.S. in any manner (e.g. hand-carry, web, courier, visually)

-  Release to a U.S. citizen employed by a foreign company, including
   non-incorporated branches
