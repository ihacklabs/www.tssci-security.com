ShmooCon getting nearer
#######################

The list of `speakers <http://www.shmoocon.org/speakers.html>`_ and
`schedule <http://www.shmoocon.org/schedule.html>`_ for ShmooCon has
been posted. A lot of interesting topics to check out, it's so hard to
choose. My friend Ryan Clarke is speaking on "Extend your Code into the
Real World," a look at electronics and hardware hacking. Ryan now
teaches at my university and also runs the LosT @ Con Mystery Challenge
at Defcon each year.

If you're going to attend ShmooCon, post a comment or reply to this
`discussion
thread <http://community.securitycatalyst.com/forums/index.php/topic,140.0.html>`_.
Also, I'm one of the lucky ones to have been chosen to participate in
ShmooCon labs, and "get hands on time implementing cutting edge security
tools in a real world environment." You can learn more about `ShmooCon
Labs <http://www.shmoocon.org/labs.html>`_:

    ...As a vendor you will get a chance to implement your gear in an
    untrusted, potentially hostile environment of 1000+ hackers.

    We are building a network that needs to be up and running in time
    for the conference so be prepared to jump in the fire. During
    Shmoocon various aspects of the network will be made available for
    attendees to hack on and all vendors should expect their products to
    get looked over with a fine tooth comb or a 20 pound hammer.

I am interested to see what vendors will be representing themselves and
show their true colors, at a real security conference, and not some pony
show in San Francisco...
