Full-disclosure debate gone mainstream (v. terrorism)
#####################################################

Today I came across a `news
article <http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_story/0,3566,292689,00.html>`_
in reply to a question asked by Steven D. Levitt, "`If you were a
terrorist, how would you
attack? <http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/if-you-were-a-terrorist-how-would-you-attack/>`_\ "
The blog posting has struck controversy among many people, and it just
reminds me of all the full-disclosure debates we have had in the
security industry. Does spelling out attacks on paper help the bad guys?
I wouldn't doubt many of the ideas that people come up with have already
been discussed and analyzed by various terrorist groups.

What frightens me more is the possibility of those posting suggestions
going on some \*-watch-list.
