Projects Page
#############

I've started (finally) filling out the
`projects <http://www.tssci-security.com/projects/>`_ section on my
site. Check it out, I've got a couple neat scripts I wrote for
performing various tasks. The section will continue to grow as I get
better with various scripting languages and write cooler/better/longer
scripts. Feel free to comment on any of them, how to improve them, add
more functionality, etc. Programming's probably my weakest area, so any
input would be appreciated. :)
