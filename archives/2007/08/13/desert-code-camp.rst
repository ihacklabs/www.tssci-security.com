Desert Code Camp
################

For those living in Phoenix, `Desert Code
Camp <http://desertcodecamp.com/default.aspx>`_ is upon us. All morning
and afternoon on **Saturday, September 15** will be full of sessions
that are all about code. My friend Adam Muntner (founder of
`QuietMove <http://www.quietmove.com/>`_ and contributor to `Security
Catalyst <http://www.securitycatalyst.com/>`_) will be presenting three
sessions on information security. They are:

**Achieving PCI Compliance** *Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standards, also knowns as PCI DSS, are a set of regulations governing
how payment card data can be stored, processed, and transmitted. The
presenter will share his experiences in helping organizations ranging
from small ecommerce development shops to the Fortune 1000 to achieve
and maintain PCI compliance.*

**Security in the Software Development Lifecycle** *Adam Muntner will
share his experiences about how organizations can integrate application
security into all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle, from
the creation of functional specifications all the way through
development, deployment, maintenance, and updates. He will explain how
to "bake security in" rather than "ice it on."*

**Web Application Hacking - Attack and Defense** *Recognizing the
competitive advantage of speed to market, organizations are under
pressure to develop and deploy applications as rapidly as possible.
According to Gartner Group, 75% of attacks are now focused against the
application layer. The combination of rapid development deadlines with
the most targeted attack vector often leads to insufficient security
analysis, testing, and validation through the entire software
development lifecycle. The results are predictable - regulatory
compliance headaches, erosion of customer confidence, and ultimately
financial loss.*

*By learning about the tools and techniques used by crackers to
penetrate applications, participants will learn how to defend against
application-layer attacks.*

There will also be a track presented by Lisa Kachold on Securing
E-Commerce Information (no abstract at this time).
