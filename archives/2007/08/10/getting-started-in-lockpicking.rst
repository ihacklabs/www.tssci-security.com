Getting started in lockpicking
##############################

This past weekend at DefCon, I had the opportunity to hang out with a
couple people at the Lockpicking Village. I first met Deviant Ollam and
Mouse and the crew back at ShmooCon. It was a lot of fun; I learned to
break out of a pair of handcuffs in just a few seconds. Since then, I
have been compiling a list of resources and guides on the fine art of
lockpicking.

First paper that I read and would recommend to anyone else is the
original, `MIT Guide to
Lockpicking <http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/mitlg-a4.pdf>`_
[pdf]. You can also read it in `HTML
format <http://www.capricorn.org/~akira/home/lockpick/>`_. This paper
goes over all the basics of the locksmith trade, and you'll understand
how locks work, how a key opens a lock, and the methods for picking a
lock.

`TOOOL (The Open Organization Of Lockpickers) <http://toool.us/>`_ is a
great resource for all things lockpicking, and they actually run the
Lockpicking Village at DefCon/ShmooCon. Deviant Ollam also has his own
`page <http://deviating.net/lockpicking/topics.html>`_ up with links to
an overwhelming amount of information. Each page has animated GIF's,
pictures, and write-ups on everything from lock & pick theory to bump
keys to lubricants to gun locks. Definitely a page you'll want to add to
your bookmarks.

A popular forum with frequent activity related to the trade is `Lock
Picking 101 <http://www.lockpicking101.com/>`_. There are a ton of
threads, posts, and members that have all asked and answered most every
question you might have starting out and as you become more advanced.
Don't forget to `read the
law <http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?t=2850>`_,
`twice <http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?t=863>`_.

That's it for now... Buy some locks, a pick set (or make your own; we
made some out of street sweeper bristles before), sit down and read and
practice. I'll post about this subject intermittently -- I'm still
getting the hang of it. It's been a fun little hobby :)
