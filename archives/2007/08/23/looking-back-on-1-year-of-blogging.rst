title: Looking back on 1 year of blogging

Looking back on 1 year of blogging
##################################

Today marks the 1 year anniversary of tssci security. I first started
this blog last year with a goal to put my thoughts on security and
technology in general out into the open. Since I started, I've learned a
lot from other bloggers and people who read and comment on my blog. The
blog has helped me develop relationships, make friends and establish
contacts in the security industry. It makes for a great conversation
starter with people, especially with those who recognize my name and my
blog's title. It helped land me an internship with a `Fortune
10 <http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/snapshots/561.html>`_
company and probably has been the best career move I've made so far
being only 20 years old (21 just a couple days away!).

I plan on continuing to share with you all my experience and knowledge
as I get older and learn more. To conclude today's post, I'd like to
express my sincerest thanks to everyone whose read, subscribed,
commented, emailed, IM'd, met and chatted with me over the last year.
Special thanks to the Catalyst Community and to **LonerVamp** and
**dre** -- you guys are awesome.

-Marcin
