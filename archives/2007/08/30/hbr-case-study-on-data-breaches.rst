HBR case study on data breaches

`Boss, I Think Someone Stole Our Customer

The way
`Hoff <http://rationalsecurity.typepad.com/blog/2007/08/harvard-busines.html>`_
puts it, sounds all too familiar. I can't count the number of times I've
heard people talk about their systems and believe they're as secure as
can be because they did one, some, or all of the following:

-  SSL
-  Encrypted data
-  X compliance/HackerSafe
-  Disable unused services and close ports
-  Penetration test
-  Vulnerability scan (No, a vulnerability scan is not the same as a pen
   test, and an Nmap scan is not a vulnerability scan)
-  Code Review

And then you say, "a determined hacker given enough time could break
into it anyways." Ah! Should "good enough" be allowed in a security
professionals' vocabulary?

Where was the Flayton's computer security incident response team
(CSIRT)? The Secret Service was conducting surveillance to try and catch
the perpetrator red handed. A competent CSIRT (not affiliated with any
of the employees with access to the system) should have been on task
right away to realize whether the affected cards was a result of a data
breach at Flayton's. I agree with Jay Foley of the Identity Theft
Resource Center in San Diego and think the CIO didn't have a grasp of
the situation at all, before and after the incident.

    CEO: "Are you saying, Sergei, that we're not actually PCI
    compliant?"

    CIO: "We meet about 75% or so of the PCI requirements. That's better
    than average for retailers of our size."

    CEO: "How have we been able to get away with that?"

    CIO: "They don't scan us every day," Sergei demurred. "Compliance
    really is up to us, to me, in the end."

Yah, I think we really need to stop using compliance for needing
security and doing security for compliance, and actually start doing
security to be secure. A
`survey <http://www.gcn.com/print/26_21/44863-1.html>`_ conducted
recently of 250 CIO's and CISO's states 99% feel more secure this year
than last. What??!
