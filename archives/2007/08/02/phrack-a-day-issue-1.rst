Phrack a Day -- Issue 1
#######################

Here's our first "Phrack a Day" posting. We first mentioned this segment
`here <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/07/24/phrack-a-day-revitalizing-what-has-been-lost/>`_.
We won't be able to comment on every phile as we did this one, but we'll
do our best to keep them short, informative, and entertaining. We also
won't pretend like we know wtf an article is talking about when it's way
over our heads, so we're counting on you guys to fill in the blanks for
us. There are also some philes that are self-explanatory, [now] common
knowledge, etc. that we may just end up skipping. Post any feedback or
comments -- we'd love to hear them! Also don't forget to post in the
Phrack's comments section as well.

**Hacking SAM - A Description Of The Dial-Up Security System** by
*Spitfire Hacker*

I honestly have no idea what SAM is. A Google search returned many
results back to this phile, but also turned up this
`pdf <www.gdc.com/inotes/pdf/0171_SCSAM_AB06.pdf>`_ on Global DataComm
Modem Security.

**THE PHONE PHREAK'S FRY-UM GUIDE** by *Iron Soldier*

We love pranks, especially getting your friends. This one takes the
cake, totally ruining someone's day. Call up the phone company and
cancel the guy's phone, order a stack of phone books, The modern day
equivalent would be calling up the local pizza shops and Chinese
restaurants and ordering delivery to some loser's address.

Or how about that time we called Poison Control:

> Can you help me? My router has a poisioned arp cache. >> Say what?? >
It swallowed a TCP packet with a malformed header.

bahaha... good times :)

**How to Pick Master Locks** by *Ninja NYC*

This trick was just cool. Remember your classmates would try and listen
to the clicks like they do in the movies and end up failing at opening
the lock? Well, this trick did work. Masterlock has since made it harder
to break, but look no further, WikiHow shows you how to `crack the
combo <http://www.wikihow.com/Crack-a-Master-Combination-Lock>`_. Hack A
Day also had a
`post <http://www.hackaday.com/2005/06/22/master-lock-picking/2>`_ back
in 2005 with video and a link showing how to `recover a lost
combo <http://www.fusor.us/lockpick.html>`_. In gym class, most of us
would just give up and take a folding chair and slam the backrest
against the handle. Don't forget the `Bic pen
trick <http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-67493.html>`_ with
Kryptonite U-locks.

**Acetylene Balloon Bomb** by *The Clashmaster & Gin Fizz*

Step 1, Fill a bathtub with water. Step 2, Submerge balloon in water and
remove all oxygen. Step 3, Fill balloon up with acetylene. Step 4, Take
balloon out, twist the opening shut. Let dry. Step 5, Open balloon and
insert a rock with a fun-snap.

I read this thinking, there's no way this works the way it's
constructed. How would a fun-snap pop on impact when it's inside the
balloon? This is just one of those projects you'd sit back and say, "eh,
I'll let someone else try this one." If anyone has gotten it to work the
way it's described, let me know.

**Schools and University Numbers** by *Phantom Phreaker*

Several years ago our university had a 56k modem bank for remote access
service (RAS). We found that the numbers were listed for students to
access the intranet homepage. One day, I dialed in to access our online
classroom and realized it put me on the same subnet as the student
workstations located in the common area. I began screwing around with
various settings for gateways and proxies, and found one proxy that
would allow me out of the network. I then set up a router in my
apartment and shared the 56k dialup Internet connection with some shady
dude who lived across the hall. Our university eventually took the modem
bank offline and we had to get our own connection. :/

\*\*\*

Well, that's it for this issue. This issue was relatively short and not
as technical or security oriented. Future posts may end up being broken
up across the week depending on how technical and lengthy the philes
get. Hope you enjoyed reading this; subscribe to the `RSS
