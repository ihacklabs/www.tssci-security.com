Going to keep this one short... nothing too exciting in this issue.

`Phrack Issue Two <http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=2>`_ --
Released 01/01/1986

**Universal Informational Services via ISDN** by *Taran King*

This phile is a basic overview of
`ISDN <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN>`_.

    The central idea of ISDN, as AT&T Network Systems sees it, is to
    provide an individual user a link to the local central office of
    generous band-width - a digital subscriber line that can carry
    144,000 bits per second (sure beats 2400 baud!).

144,000 bits = 17.5KB. There are two types of ISDN implementations,
`Basic Rate Interface
(BRI) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Rate_Interface>`_ and `Primary
Rate Interface
(PRI) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Rate_Interface>`_. Today PRI
circuits are used for voice, however BRI circuits have been widely
replaced by alternatives such as DSL. To have an ISDN Internet
connection back in 1986 would have been pimp. 17.5kB/s should have been
more than enough for anyone!

Anyone have a PDP-11?
