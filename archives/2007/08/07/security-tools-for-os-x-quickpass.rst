Security Tools for OS X -- QuickPass
####################################

I am an avid OS X user and will be posting tools and security
information regarding OS X regularly. I often need to create secure
passwords that are easy to remember and today I found the perfect tool
for doing this. It's called QuickPass and it's a small freeware
application that runs in your toolbar. Each time you click on the key
logo it will generate and display a new list of passwords based on your
criteria specified in the preferences dialog.

You can get QuickPass
`here <http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/networking_security/quickpass.html>`_.
