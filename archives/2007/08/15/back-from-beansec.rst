Back from BeanSec
#################

|beansec3.jpg|\ Thanks to everyone involved at making this a successful
event. It was my first time out to BeanSec, but unfortunately will
likely be my last this year (I am going back to school in September). I
made the two hour drive all the way out from Hartford, CT, and it was a
blast. There were about thirty people in attendance at The Enormous Room
in Cambridge, Mass from 6:30pm up until 9:30~10pm.

It was fun hanging out with `Chris
Hoff <http://rationalsecurity.typepad.com/blog/>`_ (who btw, was an
excellent host), Oliver Day, Mike, Tim from Arbor Networks, Christian
and his fellow Cisco colleagues, and
Joshua\ ` <http://pbnj.sourceforge.net/>`_.

I'm sorry if I forgot to mention anyone. I know there are a couple of
you, but I forgot/didn't catch your names. Just post here in the
comments and leave a link to your personal site or blog. My next CitySec
gathering that I'll be attending is SunSec in Phoenix.
