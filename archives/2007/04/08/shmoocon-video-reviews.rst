LonerVamp has been watching
`ShmooCon <http://www.shmoocon.org/2007/videos/>`_ videos all day long
and has posted his
`thoughts <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/04/shmoocon_simple_nomad_and_clar.html>`_
on several of
`them <http://www.terminal23.net/2007/04/shmoocon_2007.html>`_.

My favorite talks (that have been uploaded) from ShmooCon are the
following:

-  Extend Your Code into the Real World
-  No-Tech Hacking
-  RFIDiots
-  Weaponizing Noam Chomsky
