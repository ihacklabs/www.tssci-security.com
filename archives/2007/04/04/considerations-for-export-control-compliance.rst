title: Considerations for Export Control Compliance

Considerations for Export Control Compliance
############################################

Expanding on my previous blog post regarding export control and how it
is defined, there are several other factors to take into consideration
to help ensure compliance.

-  Record Keeping

   -  All export records must be kept for five years after license
      expiration, even if no license required (NLR).

   -  Maintain a log of all exports (e.g. method of transport,
      supplement technical data)

   -  Keep a copy of the invoice, bill, and data exported if physically
      exported

   -  Keep a record of servers, usernames, and data sent when using any
      electronic medium

-  Hiring Foreign Nationals and Outsourcing

   -  Where will work be done?

   -  Where is the end-use?

   -  Access by a FN on-site to a database or file share with technical
      data is still an export

-  Use ACLs and/or Domains to grant appropriate permissions to employees
   of U.S. citizen ship and foreign nationals.

-  Consider physical badge colors and combinations to identify U.S.
   citizens, contractors, and foreign nationals.

-  Other considerations:

   -  Protect intranet web pages

   -  Exchange calendar settings and items

   -  Email chains

   -  Print outs, desk tops

   -  Teleconference lurkers
