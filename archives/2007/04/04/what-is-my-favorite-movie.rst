title: What is my favorite movie?!!

What is my favorite movie?!!
############################

I asked a colleague once how to answer those silly questions, you know,
the ones banks and other sites like to use to reset passwords? They're
used to verify you are, who you say you "were." Well, my bank at the
start of the year had introduced some security enhancements to their
site and also required me to `choose and answer five
questions <http://www.tssci-security.com/archives/2007/01/24/what-does-your-fathers-middle-name-first-car-and-high-school-mascot-all-have-in-common/>`_.

So today, I'm in a hurry and want to login to my bank account before I
head off to class and before taking me to my account, it asks me "What
is your favorite movie?" Ummm, okay.. What did I put? I completely
forgot! My favorite movies change frequently, and I ended up going
through Facebook and MySpace profiles to try and remember what my
favorite movie could be (I have so many??), and no luck! After about
trying fifteen different titles (are the answers case sensitive?), the
page displays a notice that my online account has been disabled and call
some number to unlock it.

What bullshit! And this happened to someone who's relatively "security
aware" (in my opinion). I felt the frustration so many of our own users
feel when they do not remember that stupid, ridiculously
hard-to-remember password we make them change every 45 days. The problem
is that my bank likes to randomly pick and choose when to ask you these
questions. In my case, it was extremely frustrating.

Oh, and almost immediately after I got locked out of my account, one of
my instructors had reminded of a quote from my favorite movie.. Want to
know what it was?? Yeah, that's right...

Office Space.
