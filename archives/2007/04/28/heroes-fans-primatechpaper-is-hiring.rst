Heroes Fans, PrimaTechPaper is hiring
#####################################

|image0|\ If you're a fan of Heroes, and into security, check out
`PrimaTechPaper <http://www.primatechpaper.com/>`_. For those who don't
follow the show, PrimaTechPaper is a front for the agency Mr. Bennett
(father of the cheerleader) works for. This site has a "Hacker's
challenge"/puzzle type feel to it and my first clue to you guys is to
give the number a call and take it from there.

Good luck -- Save the packets, save the world!
