We share your pain

A funny slide taken from `Windows WSYP
Project <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q_EPUXlyME>`_:

-  Security is (or will be) your job. Security is your life. You are
   **security** for your org.
-  If you wanna be good, there are things you have gotta know--

   -  How to say "I don't know"
   -  How to say "That's not allowed" without giving away the fact that
      you really don't know
   -  How to look innocent -- or mean -- really, it's all situational
   -  How to say "It's not my fault" even though you screwed up the
      configuration really good
   -  How to deflect blame towards others
   -  How to speak the language of network communications
