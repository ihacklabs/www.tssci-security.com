title: Hilarious, I'll never drink that much again!

Hilarious, I'll never drink that much again!
############################################

And the post of the day goes to `Mike
Rothman <http://securityincite.com/TDI-2007-04-16#TSN1>`_, and his
comments on `Javelin's research
survey <http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=121695>`_ that
claims 77% of 2750 consumers said they would not shop at stores that
suffered data breaches.

    I think this number is crap. Why? The analogy I'll use is drinking,
    which is something I can relate to. If you asked me at 10 AM the
    morning after a bender whether I'd be drinking again, the answer
    would be no. By 7 PM, my headache had abated and I was ready to
    rumble again.

Haha, spot on! He then explains his reasoning:

    If you ask someone a question when they have still festering road
    rash, the answer will be no - every single time. But time heals,
    memories fade, and venomous anger yields to forgiveness and
    forgetfulness.

Would you shop at TJMaxx or other stores after knowing they suffered
such a massive security breach? Maybe this is just a reminder -- that
**cash is still king!**
