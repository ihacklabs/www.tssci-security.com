What's the big deal about WEP??
###############################

Andy IT Guy writes, `"I think we need to focus on in not how to crack
what is already broken but how can we protect what is using it. I'd love
to see WEP go away but it won't happen anytime
soon." <http://andyitguy.blogspot.com/2007/04/im-confused.html>`_ Andy
hits the nail right on the head with this one. A lot of people are just
starting to get WEP enabled on their old wireless 802.11b access points,
and to tell them they need to upgrade again just for security isn't
going to convince many of them. Here's my reasoning for sticking with
WEP:

I am still using WEP, because I don't feel like going out and replacing
all two wireless cards in my computers to support WPA. I'm a college
student and don't have the money to spend frivolously on every new
technology (even if it is better or more secure) that comes out. Every
time I hear about [the insecurity of] WEP, bells ring telling me to
upgrade, but I keep pushing it off. Maybe until a new standard is
ratified, maybe not.
