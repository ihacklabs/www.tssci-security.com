title: You get burned playing with FIRE

You get burned playing with FIRE
################################

I wish I had posted this when I first wanted to about four weeks ago,
(and maybe have saved some people from losing money) but
`SourceFire <http://finance.google.com/finance?q=FIRE>`_ was not a good
investment! No matter how much I support Snort IDS as an open source
project, I don't want to put what limited, hard earned money I have into
a company that's failing to meet financials, in debt up to their necks,
and slowing growth and revenues. From what I could tell, people jumped
on the SourceFire bandwagon just because it was a security company and
had friends in the game. In the game of stocks, I think Jim Cramer says
it best "I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to make money."
