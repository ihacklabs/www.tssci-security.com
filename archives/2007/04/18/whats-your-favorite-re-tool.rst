What's your favorite RE tool?
#############################

I'm looking for suggestions on any tools to reverse engineer programs
for Windows based systems. I have the \*nix and BSD bases covered; I'm
just lacking a good, Windows toolkit. Particularly, tools to analyze
memory, disassemble, debug, etc... I've heard positive reviews for `IDA
Pro <http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/>`_, from DataRescue. Any other,
[free] alternatives?

Post a comment here, I appreciate any feedback. Thanks :)
