Pentesting Flex
###############

I've posted an entry over on my employer's blog on `Penetrating
Intranets through Adobe Flex
Applications <http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/b/2010/03/17/penetrating-intranets-through-adobe-flex-applications/>`_.
I've also released a new tool along with it, called Blazentoo. This tool
exploits insecurely configured BlazeDS Proxy Services, potentially
allowing you to browse internal web sites. You can download Blazentoo
from `GDS' tools page <http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/t.php>`_.

Also, be sure to check out my other post from a while back, `Pentesting
Adobe Flex Applications with a Custom AMF
Client <http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/b/2009/11/11/pentesting-adobe-flex-applications-with-a-custom-amf-client/>`_.
This post goes into how to write a client using Python to make remoting
calls with a remote Flex server.
