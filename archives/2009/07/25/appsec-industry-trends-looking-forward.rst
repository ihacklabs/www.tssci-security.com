Appsec industry trends - looking forward
########################################

Recently, it has come to my attention that industry people I respect
(and vice versa) have desired me to re-post some comments I've made on
other blogs.

It's also high-time that we at TS-SCI/Security begin writing again. I
can tell you that since March (our last post), Marcin and I have been
involved heavily in our day-to-day work at client-sites and other
community efforts/projects.

A lot of new research is going to begin to become available from
BlackHat/Defcon. It's just that time of year where everyone starts to
share their work with others. While we can't exactly reveal everything
that we're working on quite yet, be sure to check in for updates. I have
been begging Marcin to post something on an HTTP-related argument we got
into about the Post/Redirect/Get pattern, as one example.

**Comment gone wrong #1**

There was some interesting discussion lately on the `OWASP News
Podcast <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Podcast>`_, in particular,
`Podcast 32 <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Podcast_32>`_. This is the
first News Podcast that I missed (I was on a plane at the time we
recorded), and having just listened to it -- I certainly think it's
worth your time to listen to.

This particular News Podcast set off a blog post from Jeremiah Grossman
where he says `OWASP Podcast #32 pulls no
punches <http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/07/owasp-podcast-32-pulls-no-punches.html>`_.
I attempted to comment, but the comment eventually disappeared --
perhaps Jeremiah didn't appreciate my insights. Others did, so here it
is:

*on the appsec market maturity and potentiality prediction -- i rate
[discount black-box appsec SaaS] as low-value, and in the future, will
continue to be low-value.*

*selling discount app pen-tests hurts infosec management as a whole
because you're trying to tell ciso's that they can buy some freedom for
$25k/yr (or whatever it is). in reality, they need to spend millions of
dollars over several years.*

*discount app pen-tests need to go out of style. here's why: because the
middle-ground and potential high-value comes from partnering with a
trusted adviser (i.e. an appsec consulting company), or attempting to
retain this talent in-house (which most companies -- including Microsoft
who built lists of individual talent to target -- have pretty much
failed).*

*every BPO (business process outsourcing) expert knows that the ideal is
to avoid "discount" shops and focus on real partnerships, but don't give
any single one partnership everything.*

*for example, attempt to retain 20% of your appsec program internally
ASAP (this does take time -- don't expect it to happen overnight), while
outsourcing initially 20% to one minor company (e.g. Gotham Digital
Science, Aspect Security, Denim Group, Matasano, Independent Security
Evaluators), then adding a bigger company (e.g.
Accenture/McAfee/Verisign) for another 20% to take over the smaller
company's 20% if [expectations are not met -- or major changes occur,
such as buyouts]. The next step is to figure out a balance of adding
more consulting companies somewhere in the 40-80% range, while growing
your internal talent.*

*investing in this model is extremely expensive and extremely difficult
to manage. ciso's are having problems finding/retaining talent, drafting
RFI's, reading RFP's, following up on references, and deciding who is
really talented and how that talent applies to the applications in their
appsec programs. most can't or won't even draft an appsec policy.*

*[low-bid/low-value app pen-test houses, especially SaaS-based ones]
convolute and diminish the returns that are necessary to build or even
start an efficient appsec program. that's EXACTLY what Andrew van der
Stock was trying to say.*

*if you want software security ROI, go read Sadbury, Soo Hoo, and
Jacquith's "Tangible ROI through secure software engineering" or follow
any of the work that Steve McConnell has done, which this referenced
paper was based on.*

*if you want to keep selling the idea that your McDonalds solution is
the bread-and-butter of modern appsec innovation... best of luck to you.
there's plenty of analysts, whole appsec consulting businesses,
bloggers, and podcasters that are all saying that a) you're wrong, b)
you sell a one-size-fits-all solution to companies that "don't get it"
which almost forces them to stay in the "don't get it" mode
near-permanently, and c) the jury is out and the case is closed: appsec
consulting is the correct path and one-stop-shops that do one-off, cheap
app pen-tests are so 2008.*

**Aftermath and reasoning**

My comments were due in part to actual recent industry analyst research,
so they were not unfounded or inappropriate. More to the point, they
were factual and unbiased.

Chenxi Wang, Ph.D., Robert Whiteley, and Margaret Ryan of Forrester
Research published a report entitled `TechRadar For SRM Professionals:
Application Security, Q3 2009 Application
Security Comes Of Age Despite A Slowdown In Security
Spend <http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,48394,00.html>`_.
The date on the report was July 18th, 2009.

In the report, several technologies were evaluated, including:

#. **Application scanning**
#. **Application security consulting**
#. **Application security SaaS**
#. **Penetration testing**
#. **Protocol testing**
#. **Software protection**
#. **Source code analysis**
#. **Web application firewall**

discussed many of them. Take these examples:
