Blackhat USA 2009 / Defcon 17
#############################

It's that time of year again, where we all come out of hiding and meet
in Sin City to cause nothing but trouble. The brave venture out into the
scorching hot sun during the day and some even dare tempt the waters at
Rehab. The rest of us wait until dark, with the neon lights flickering
in our eyes, with nothing on our mind but money and skin. As we wander
like zombies from club to club, night becomes day and day becomes night,
we keep going -- amazingly, ready, for the next round of mental
exploitation. Now... where did these baseball cards come from?

See you all in Vegas!
