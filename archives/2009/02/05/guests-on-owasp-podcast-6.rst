Guests on OWASP Podcast #6
##########################

`Jim Manico <http://manicode.blogspot.com/>`_ invited Dre and I to join
him with Brian Holyfield on this week's `OWASP
Podcast <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Podcast_6>`_. Topics of
discussion included our thoughts on web application security, WAFs,
training, among others. Give it a listen, and tell us what you think.

Brian introduced a tool he has been working on, `SPF - Secure Parameter
Filter <http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/spf/>`_, which has the features we
would like to see in WAFs, and would recommend people checking out as an
alternative to implementing a commercial WAF as a short-term fix.
